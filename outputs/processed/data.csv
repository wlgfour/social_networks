2 hour delays are almost par for course, and easily dealt with by sitting somewhere with a drink and scrolling your phone or checking out the shops. Or you could've easily checked flight status *before* you left the house.

While yes, being told of the delay during the layover would've been ideal, I would never count on someone to stay in reliable contact while they're travelling and/or in transit. Oftentimes they (airlines and passengers) don't even know how long a delay would be, as things are being dealt with. Sometimes delays happen *while* they're in the air, with no way to contact you.

You blamed your girlfriend for not communicating with you, then failed to communicate with her in turn. You drove 40 minutes home over a 2 hour (or 90 minute) wait on a day you had nothing else planned, and for what, really?",1,-0.318

My father wouldn’t allow one, so I made friends with every dog on my street and several streets over.  Had a family move  in across the street that were sort of fun and raucous and they had a little dog that was often the star of the show.  He was something special and I quickly fell under his spell.  But, to a point.  

I learned not to be squeamish about having a sip of soda or sweet tea after my friends.  But, ack, they would let the dog drink after them and continue drinking from the same cup.  And, offer me a sip.  Um. No.  Ew.  They would claim that dog saliva was cleaner than people spit.  As, I watched the dog lick it’s own butt.

Grew up, moved out, got married and had a number of dogs over the years  that I adored.  Pile up in bed with my pet, yep.  Eat or drink after them, nope,  in fact, I taught them to not even lick my face.  I dunno.  It just grosses me out and I’m not particularly germaphobic.  Still had a loving relationship with all of them, just had that boundary.

This boundary extended to the kitchen, while food was being prepared.  A stern look and command, “get out of my kitchen!” sent them away, baleful looks and all.  It wasn’t just for sanitary reasons, but also safety ones.  I didn’t want to be trip over them or risk spilling hot liquids on them.  Besides, they knew that they got dog appropriate small treats in their dishes later.  Whenever I’d step out of the kitchen during food prep and touch the dog for whatever reason, I’d scrub my hands.  Wasn’t about to contaminate food with dog fuzz or slobber for family or guests.

I see this as teaching children that there is a time and a place for everything.

I absolutely hate having to hear random people/kids singing during non-appropriate times and as someone who grew up with the glee generation, school was awful.

I don’t see anywhere that you told your daughter she has a bad singing voice, which would be a mean way to handle this. You simply told her to either do it in her room (an appropriate singing location) or to stop for the noise-level comfort of others in the family. You are establishing noise boundaries in the same way you can ask kids to use their “inside voice” to keep them from screaming all the time.

As long as you never negatively comment on the singing itself, I think you are fine. Hasn’t every kid been told “Sweetie, you’re singing is beautiful but mom has a headache. Can we stop for right now?”",2,-0.391

*Constructive* criticism is pointing out where things could be done better, and how it can be improved. An overall remark like ""the performance was disappointing"" does nothing but undermine what good parts there were of it. Your MIL is not being ""supportive"" or ""constructive"" by belittling your daughter's efforts and undermining her self-esteem, and your husband needs to get his head outta his ass for enabling her. I'd bitchslap the woman if she comes anywhere near your daughter again, honestly.

People who justify their ""harsh truths"" with ""just telling it how it is"" etc... are more interested in being ""harsh"" than being ""truthful"".

**ETA:** Creative pursuits train the brain to think in different ways, and are otherwise invaluable tools to de-stress from high-pressure occupations (such as, *dundundun*, medicine!) Even if she doesn't use them later in life, she would be a much more flexible and adaptable for having various experiences to draw from. And success comes in many forms; she might well find something she enjoys and excels in that make her just as high-earning, successful, fulfilled, etc... as being a doctor.

Look, I understand how important conversion can be to people, and how difficult those conversations can be. I also understand the desire to have Jewish kids and carry on the lineage, especially given the Holocaust.

That said, Eve has her own beliefs and value system and she is under no obligation to change them for you or your family. It was fine to ask if she would convert, but you should have respected her initial no and not asked again. As you should know, conversion is a big deal and it's supposed to be done seriously and willingly. If she doesn't feel Jewish then she should not convert. I'd actually say she's being very *respectful* of Judaism by not going through an insincere conversion to appease you and your family.

If you want to stay together, you should apologize for not listening to her initial ""no"" and clarify that you will respect it from now on, *and* stick up for her if your family gives her grief over it.

There are a few ways you could handle this:

1. You could ask her if she would be willing to have your kids converted at birth. I have a friend who was converted at birth because his dad was Jewish and his mom didn't want to convert. His dad's family accepted that compromise. Again, if she says no, you need to respect her decision--but you can ask, *once*.
2. I understand that if she does not convert, your kids will not be halachically Jewish, but that's not the only way to be Jewish. Children of Jewish fathers and non-Jewish mothers are ethnically Jewish and many identify as Jews. They carry on the Jewish lineage as much as halachic Jews do. If you no longer live as Modern Orthodox, perhaps that's something you can accept (especially since Reform accepts children of Jewish fathers as full Jews).
3. If this is really a deal-breaker for you and you cannot get past the fact that she *does not want to convert*, you can end the relationship. Frankly I think this would be a little silly, given that you don't live as Modern Orthodox anymore. But if you really can't get past this, it'll be better for both of you if you're honest about it.

I can also guarantee that she's not refusing to convert because she's secretly Catholic. Many atheists won't convert either, since you can't be a sincere convert to Judaism if you don't believe in God.",1,0.977

Sure, your MILs behavior has always been awful, especially after your ex got pregnant the first time. But from almost immediately after the opportunity presented itself (your ex getting diagnosed), she started pushing for your child to live with her. No discussions, strategies, back-up plans, just…MINE. NOW!

But the biggest red flag is that after weeks of no contact with you or your child, your ex suddenly wants full custody. These weeks were spent in her mother’s house. Weeks of having her in your ex’s ear. Probably using everything in her power to persuade your ex that you shouldn’t have any custody whatsoever, so that if the worst happens with your ex, then your MIL would get custody (since they were already living with MIL).

If your parents are being respectful and polite, then there isn't much that you really can do. Unless your wife wants them to be fake then she is in a weird position here. While I'm sure it's hurtful for her to not be embraced, her expectations are too high. 

Holding your son hostage from them, until they start acting fake to her, is only hurting her son. She needs to put her feelings aside, and do what's best for your son if they adore him. It's a power move on her part to use your son as a pawn. It's only okay when your child is being harmed. Honestly, you need to put your foot down for your son's sake.

Him making 2:1 what she does is necessary to the story, and it's not like he mentioned it over and over. He mentioned it twice (at least in the OP, I didn't read all his comments).

Using monopoly money is an excellent way to explain it. It gives a _visual_ aid, which can be helpful when previous attempts at mathematical explanations fail. And it worked.

That being said, the comment about the ""failure of the education system"" was unnecessary and unkind. But I think you're interpreting this story as even more condescending than it is.

&gt;if the woman in the argument feels like she has been mansplained, then she was most likely mansplained!

On AITA, I'm hesitant to accept this type of argument (""Most X are Y. A is an X. Therefore, A is probably a Y.""). For it to work, you need to be reasonably sure that the ""A"" in question is a *typical* ""X"". Stories that come up here are often atypical.

IMO, this scenario is **not** a typical a mansplaining accusation: The condescension I see came _after_ she was unable to initially understand his mathematical explanation, and his unkind condescension is plausibly related to her failure, not her gender.

**It’s easier to dump a mama’s boy than to divorce a mama’s boy, and both of those are easier than trying to change a mama’s boy.**

The ink is barely dry on the marriage certificate and yet he is so enmeshed with his family that he sees zero issues with them joining you on what’s seen as the *most intimate vacation a married couple* ever takes. At the very least and most innocent, this is just plain rude &amp; inconsiderate. At the worst, it’s beyond creepy, amongst other really gross thoughts I don’t want write down.

And to add further fuel to this icky dumpster fire, he completely ignores &amp; invalidates your *extremely normal* feelings &amp; concerns. He has already shown you quite clearly where you rate in his priorities. If he thinks, within days of getting married, that you wanting to spend your honeymoon alone is being difficult, try to imagine what he’ll think of you or how he’ll respond to any number of scenarios down the road.

Who extended their hand to help your brother after your family so bravely kicked him out at 14? Yes, his friends parents, that makes them already a much better family to him than yours is or will be for him, who invited who to share a good moment of his life? Your brother invited you, who went like a petty child thinking he knows everything and that he's got the right to tell people what to think and feel about something? You, only you.

You were a kid, plenty of reason to not say something and risk doing the same, you do freaking get what you wrote? If you had even SAID something to defend your brother and you'd have ended up in the street too.

God damn the hell is wrong with you? Do you really downplay the gravity of what your parents did so much that you just costed your relationship with your brother because you couldn't take the NEON HIGHWAY SIGN hint that he does not care and do not want to talk to them. He is more than right to kick you out of the wedding. And if you're lucky you won't get blocked. I know I would do it if it were me. Why is your brother the one that needs to apologize? He got kicked out, and probably was saying as much around town, where is the lie? Hard to live with the truth? Why aren't your parents apologizing for their conditional love of your brother?

That is not love or care, that is a transaction, why haven't you apologized? Hiding forever behind the card of because small? Yes, you couldn't have done anything to stop it, you did not have the means to, yet haven't even seen anywhere on your post about your feeling bad for what they did and the time you have tried to apologize to your brother.

All the people you saw at that table having a good time and to be there for him, are 10 times the family your parents and now probably you as well will ever be.

It is a lot of work to look pretty like that, to shave and wax and put on make up just right (likely redoing parts where you mess up if you are going somewhere fancy).

That also takes mental preparation, which you didn't give your wife time to expect or prepare for. If this had been planned multiple nights in advance, maybe she would have agreed and dressed up because she wanted to, but who knows.

Ultimately, the reason YTA here is because of the lack of empathy for your partner. You want her to look a certain way and it really bothers you when she doesn't, why? Why does it matter so much to you that you would hurt her, the person you love, over it?

Why are her looks more important to you than her time, comfort, or self?

Your fiancé’s brother went to rehab and is clean and you still insist on pigeonholing him as an addict. Do your fiancé a favor and call off the wedding. When you get married, you don’t just marry your spouse. You also marry into their family. So like it or not, his brother would be part of your family. And your fiancé, his brother, and his mother do not deserve a lifetime of you judging and rejecting them for mistakes made in the past that they have worked to rectify.",1,-0.46

Your daughter is acting exactly like a sexual assault victim. Considering the age gap, I would not be at all surprised if this was the case. Most victims of rape know their rapists, usually friends or family. How do you not know this?

And of course she isn't going to confide in you. You're her rapist's mother. She's worried you'll take his side. Not to mention all the shame and terror she must feel doesn't make it easy to open up in the first the place. And that reflects on you as a parent that your own daughter doesn't trust you to support her.

Your daughter is terrified of your son. Instead of badgering her to figure out why, **APOLOGIZE**, and offer to pay for her to go back to therapy. Preferably with someone experienced with treating PTSD. Don't allow your son to come over when she is home. Don't bring him up.

As your girlfriend, taking an interest in your hobbies is great, but if it’s something special to you and she should respect that.

But you are also an asshole for trying to put her down because she finished the game first. There was a nicer way to encourage her to play the “right” way and it’s clear you were intentionally trying to make her feel bad in that moment. Also, video games are video games. Please don’t gate keep.

Exactly. There a multitude of reasons why parents may not tell their children that they are adopted, or possibly a less traumatic version of why they were adopted, and it’s usually due to the children being too young to understand or cope with. 

That nurse had no way of knowing what the girl knew or what her parents have told her regarding the adoption, so she was way out of line simply by bringing it up in front of her. Then to keep pushing and practically berating OP like that, still in front of her child, was absolutely disgusting. And that’s just the nurses *actions.* Her behavior was absolutely awful, but what she was implying by her words was even worse. She completely invalidated OP being a mother and the girl being her daughter.

NTA. OP definitely needs to report the nurse, because not only was her “bedside manner” nonexistent, but she also could have caused a lot of harm and trauma to the little girl by bringing up the adoption in front of her. That’s patient negligence at the *very* least.",2,-0.944

You could have put it in her drawer, her closet, under the bed, or the damn attic.

If you don't think she should be using sex toys at all, that's your prerogative as a parent, and that changes things -- but that doesn't seem to be the issue at hand.

Even better, you can contact the Diocese (or Archdiocese, depending on the region) that the church belongs to and speak to someone in the **Office of the Chancery.** They handle stuff dealing with the sacraments (which marriage is one of) and are the local experts on canonical law regarding weddings/marriage (and a ton of other stuff that requires canonical counsel, not just sacrament related). And as far as the Church goes, (almost always) what the Diocese says, goes.

His PTSD, my trauma from childhood abuse, and kids and finances and life goals and everything else.

I'm not saying y'all are assholes for not talking about this stuff, but why would you ever get married to someone you couldn't talk to about your past and trauma? I got locked in a dryer when I was 5 and I am painfully claustrophobic to this day (I get nauseated and lightheaded watching people crawl through vents in movies, for example). I would never have married my husband without talking about that because as my partner that's something he should know so that he can support me.

Former drug user ""nutcase"" here. I know you don't understand, but try. For whatever reason, twin tried drugs. Twin got hooked on drugs. Twin went thru some shit. Now he's trying to be better.

Imagine going for a week without your morning mochafrapabullshit fix. How tired, grumpy, and unproductive would you be? Take that times 1,000. At least. Coffee consumed your life, you had carafes stashed in places to make sure you had coffee at hand 24/7. 

Now though, you've cut off caffeine. No more coffee ever, or you might lose everything. No job. No home. No friends. No family. The uphill struggle you'll face every time you so much as hear/think/SMELL coffee. But you can't. Never again. All this is just the TIP of the iceberg of what twin is facing.

 Fiancé is rightly proud of twin for trying. Maybe he'll stumble, maybe he falls off the wagon. Bit at least he's TRYING to be a better person.

YOU on the other hand, are a piece of work. He's made mistakes, so he's forever branded as less than? What about you? Never made a mistake, that by your rules you should be judged for, FOREVER? Never misspoke? Doubt it, you did a lot here. Congrats, you're forever a mumbling moron that no one needs to take seriously. Never been a heinous lump of crap? Doubtful, you've just shown us several examples. Congrats on being crowned Queen of Karen, forever.

Be uncomfortable/unhappy with twin in wedding party, fine. It's still SUPER shitty, but you seem a bit bridezilla-ish, so no surprises there. It's your right to feel however you want to feel. But not only are you shitting on a guy who's already got MORE than enough struggle on his plate, you're overriding your fiancé. It's his day too, that's his TWIN. BROTHER. To top of the crap cake, you thoroughly insult his mother, FOR BEING A SUPPORTIVE MOTHER. I genuinely hope you don't ever have kids if this concept is so alien to you.

And sadly they can come from your own family as well.

One way that helps me in deciding in a situation like this is to look at the patterns behind the many little issues and accusations. Your mother seems to try to divert your arguments and senses by always bringing up different small situations and you follow them. Try to look at all of the little situations and conflicts as ""symptoms"" of a larger issue and identify the common theme. Then you can get away from ""she wrote this on Facebook last time, even though I said other things"" and move towards ""there is a pattern of neglecting my feelings"", or ""her problem solving method is through blame and shame"". 
This can help you to stop worrying about every little situation, by sorting each encounter into ""this is my mother doing her neglection again"" for example and therefore put it behind you easier.

 Looking at the patterns will show you that the issue is not you, the bad behavior doesn't originate from you, but it a common theme with your mother. And then you can decide if you really want to put up with this emotional burden, or if it's better for you to limit the contact a lot and don't expect anything from your mother. Don't fear if you might regret anything in the future, do what's best for you right now, anything can be mended again in the future if you wish to.

I’m from Minnesota, and people here don’t show emotion. There’s an old Scandinavian joke, “I love my wife so much, I almost told her.” 
The family has always been disfunctional. History of mental disorders and just shit family dynamics.
I had trouble in school because we were a poor family and they somehow got me into a rich school. The dynamics between me and other students were so different. I did not fit in at all. I continually brought this up to my parents. The rich parents bullying me, not having much in common with my peers, getting in trouble standing up to bullies. I voiced these concerns to them, yet they always brushed it off.
In regards to me being abroad, I was gone for several years. I begged them to visit. I even offered to pay for their flights and stay for free with me, yet they always made excuses. I continually voiced concern over cultural differences and being targeted as an American, yet they seemed to not care. They’d just say,” we’ll that’s what’s happening to foreigners here.” Yeah, no shit. But can’t you at least show a bit of empathy? Then I get a back injury, and they just give me shit. They urge me to come home, so I do. I asked them to get a proper firm bed ahead of time, and I’ll pay for it. I arrive home and they didn’t do it. I had to lie on the fucking floor and sleep there a month while going through rehabilitation. I voiced my concernsover them neglecting a proper mattress for back injuries, neglecting my concerns of reverse culture shock, neglecting the shit that happened to me overseas. I started losing my mind. Why won’t even my parents show any empathy? I finally broke down and sobbed to them about the past several years. Even then, they were so cold. They’ve financially supported me since I’ve been back, but damn are they cold. Am I the asshole?",3,-0.982

Management knew, but they were day shift so they didn't ever actually have to interact with us. So they could dump bullshit all over nights and avoid asking their friends on day shift to do anything. 

I ended up going to a handful of staff meetings during the day, and it was pretty common for a new responsibility/recurring task to be brought up and then overwhelmingly decided that it should be night shift's responsibility.

It's not that the blame lies on people going to the ER when they can't pay.  It's that we have an insurance system that means hospitals don't get paid for massive amounts of the work they perform. Then we readjust prices to make up for that, which further increases the prices of insurance premiums, or the limits the insurance company is willing to pay, or reduces covered services, and of course, increases the price for self pay customers because we can't charge different prices to different entities.

I'm speaking as someone who has worked at hospitals and done everything from nursing (in the ED), to IT to medical billing in the healthcare field. The amount of treatment that goes unpaid, for a variety of reasons including ER visits, is significant and contributes to increasing healthcare costs. If we converted to a healthcare for all system, hospitals wouldn't have to write off so much medical debt, enabling them to lower prices.

Capitalism and socialism aren't even mutually exclusive. Just three steps:

1) Workers unionize and secure their rights.

2) Workers build capital in personal investment and retirement funds.


3) Workers organize politically to tax the rich, thereby closing the wealth gap.

Then we will have literal socialism, where the workers literally own the means of production through their investment funds.

And there will still be capital and the capital will be privately owned by hundreds of millions of investors

Dental checkups aren't super expensive and can be paid out of pocket a lot of the time.  You need a dozen fillings and a root canal?  Yeah, probably not gonna get those.  
Doctors visits are the same.  Going to an urgent care or a regular doctors visit can be cheap enough.  Some prescription generics are super cheap.  It all depends on what you need.  But in general, without insurance you're skipping the doctor and hoping for the best.  You're probably in relatively good health too.  


But the whole time, you're fingers crossed nothing major happens.  A simple broken bone can be covered by savings.  A ride in the weewoo wagon, a night in the hospital and an MRI and you're never going to pay for it.   
The good news is, it mostly just destroys your credit, ERs can't turn you down for lack of payment.  This however is part of the reason everyone's healthcare is so expensive and sucks.

They are now completely incompatible with the current Republican Party. It cannot be understated how much the party has shifted in the past decade. I spend a decent amount of time debating Republican friends and family. What’s sad (and also infuriating) is that a lot of them still vote Republican because they think the party represents the one they voted for decades ago. They seem to genuinely think that all this trump shit is “just a few loonies making noise on social media.” They have zero understanding that these loonies *are the ones in power, not a small minority.*

She had started a new job, was still waiting the three months before her health care kicked into effect so for the time being she had Blue Shield. Her doctor cancelled on her **FIVE** times.

She was throwing up in trash cans at work from the pain, she was weak all of the time, and she kept stressing how important and urgent this was to her clinic. The receptionist verbatim told her “no patient is more important than the other and *this is a reminder, no, you cannot be seen by another clinic, now is there anything else I can help you with today?* No? Wonderful, you have a great day.” Absolute attitude while she was in tears. She went back to the ER, got a doctors note that said “this is very likely breast cancer, but needs a mammogram and biopsy schedule immediately” to give to them and to her work. They refused to schedule it until the doctor examined her himself, which was the fourth time he cancelled. The fifth time, they didn’t even have an excuse, just that he’s not showing up that day.

Her PPO finally kicked in the first week of February, and THAT DAY she saw someone, the next day got the mammogram. 

And the day after? Her work fired her for performance issues, regardless of the doctors note, therefore cutting off her healthcare. They were all in the loop of what was going on. Oh yeah, lawsuit in the process. This is an open and shut case that many different firms were jumping at when she was calling around, but during this whole time while she has been on her feet, while HER DOCTOR canceled on her for almost two months, the mass has now spread all across her breast into her armpit.

The right wing is jealous of the educated because they know that education will give them a better life over the uneducated.


They are ok with that because they feel that atleast some of these educated came from the same class as them and therefore had to take out loans to afford college.

The right wing sees those loans as punishment inflicted upon those educated people who dare leave the uneducated behind  in their lower class.

Now the govt wants to eliminate these loans.

This means that the educated loan takers were able to escape their lower class and set themselves up for a better life AND they dont get penalized for it.
  
So its 2 good things happening to the educated while the uneducated are left to wallow in their misery.

They also see these college bound people as class traitors that dared leave them behind in their trailers to make a better life for themselves.",1,0.068

Spending days in the pool, movie/game nights in the basement, typical suburban teen shit. <U+0001F60F> On a hot mid-summer's day we decided to take ""Frenchie"" on a tour of NYC, as she'd never been. Not the whole gang... but; just me, my best friend, his girlfriend, and 'Frenchie'. Took the bus into the city, lunch in Chelsea Market, Swan boat ride in Central Park, etc. At one point while draggin' my feet behind the group, I began singing to myself (as I'm one to do). When I caught up with them at the corner 'Frenchie' then asks me, ""Why did you stop? Your voice is very nice. <U+263A><U+FE0F>"" I didn't realize anyone could hear me. Fast forward to the bus ride back, that evening and we're all pretty tired after runnin' around the city all day. I'm sat next to 'Frenchie', who rests her head on my shoulder during the ride. We get off the bus and proceed to walk back to my friend's house, just a few blocks from the bus stop. My car is parked at my friend's place and along the way, we discuss our plans for the night. A couple steps ahead of me, my buddy says he intends to drive his girlfriend home (45 min drive) and I ask 'Frenchie' what she's about to do. To which she responds, ""I was just going to go inside and watch a movie, perhaps you would like to join me?"" <U+0001F633> I then walk up to my best friend and say, ""Hey, so your cousin just invited me in to watch a movie, what are you in the mood for, when you get back??"" He looks me dead in the face and says, ""Go home, u/God_Stevenson <U+0001F928>"" And so, I did. <U+0001F926><U+0001F3FE>

TL:DR - Kinda accidentally went on a romantic double date with my best friend and his gorgeous cousin visiting from France. Though hints were dropped, I missed the cue when she invited me in to ""watch a movie."" <U+0001F643> Thinking little of it, I told my friend and he told me to ""Get lost."" So, I basically &amp; obliviously outed our fling before it ever even began. FML",1,0.993

I was interviewing for a job at a game developer / publisher called Radical Entertainment.  My prior job ended because the studio had shut down entirely.  The job would have largely centred around doing save game / memory card stuff on PS2 era console title.  Not the most compelling work, but I had done a bunch of that at my last two jobs.  I did very well in the interview and at the end of it I was told ""We would like you to become a member of the team, what is your salary expectation""

I asked for an amount of money that would have been a bit of a jump from my previous job.  The guy hesitated, said some stuff about it being a number they could probably work with, and the interview ended.

I did not get that job.  However, a guy I worked with at my prior job, who had been the other guy working on the memory card stuff on that title did get that job.

I am pretty sure he asked for less money than I did.

That interview was within 1 or 2 months of my last job ending.  It took me a full year to get another job, and required me moving quite a distance to get it.  If I had gotten that job, I think my career path would have been much closer to what I would have wanted it to be, simply because there are more jobs in the Vancouver area than there are anywhere else.

Medically disqualified from the army. To put it into perspective- I’ve been shot at before, I’ve seen other people been shot, I’ve lived overseas for several months away from family, I’ve walked by blown up buildings casually. Recently there’s been a couple incidents in my area that just brought back memories of those childhood experiences. It had gotten to the point that I would feel uncomfortable in rooms that only had one exit and I would constantly be alert. And for several months those memories just pop up daily. I think part of the reason why is because my current life just feels so boring in comparison and so it’s like an escape. The reason I leaned towards the army was because it felt like that world of constantly being alert and dealing with violence was at least somewhat familiar. So it feels like I’m kind of entering a new world- one which I have virtually no taste of and have no idea what to expect. I’ll have to try out new jobs but I’m just worried if I’ll actually like it because if there’s one thing I’ve learned- school/random courses aren’t enough to know whether or not you’re gonna like something. Yeah I don’t really know how else to explain it, it’s hard to explain without going into so much detail about what everyday life feels like for me especially since these memories started popping back up a few months ago. Imagine being wound up tight all the time, always watching people always watching the exits, always being cautious. That’s the world you know. It’s not traumatic it’s just what you’re used to. And then to suddenly have that pulled from underneath you to the point that you’re looking for a way to get that back. But instead you’re being told that you need to relax and that your abundance of caution which kept you alive in those past incidents is now actually disrupting your daily life and you’re anticipating violence in every social interaction you have with other people besides the people you’re closest to. It’s hard to explain but that’s basically what I’ve been thinking about these past few days.",4,0.706

I didn't finish puberty, lol. No facial hair, my voice kept cracking, no temporal recession of my hairline. I had anxiety and depression, and although my dick worked and I was having sex, it was always a tough mental calculus like do I really want to spend my physical effort for this. I genuinely needed to be seduced and convinced into having sex. I was also very irritable and emotional with mood swings that would give people whiplash. 

Just 3 months later, and my anxiety and depression are gone, my voice has dropped an octave. Now it's in deep voice territory, it's sick. My sex drive is great, I feel the desire to initiate, but I don't feel insatiable. I also am less needy for sex which paradoxically means I get it more. My mood is much more stable, but I'm less emotional now which is a mixed bag. My emotions are less intense now, so the lows are higher, but the highs are lower.",1,-0.857

My ultimate goal in life was to drive racecars. This is going to come off like I'm bragging, and maybe it is a little, but I have a natural talent for driving/riding. I grew up on dirtbikes and ATVs, I learned how to drive when I was 10. Racing wasn't just a dream, but a real possibility for me.

My parents actually planned to get me into karts a young age, and eventually late models... but things went south, family fell apart and the 2008 recession all but killed my dreams. I turned 18 soon after and I started bringing my own car to the track. I learned a great deal about car control from the time I spent there, but I eventually ran out of money. I had always planned to get back into the mix of things. It never came to fruition. I hit set back after set back.

I don't have any track cars anymore, I work at a mediocre paying IT job and I can't even afford my own place without roommates. Race cars just aren't possible with my budget these days.

If she is not mature enough to COMMUNICATE with you the reason why she is upset, then staying with her you are accepting and enabling this behavior.

This is the type of woman that gets off from you begging for forgiveness. She wants your attention, positive or negative, and she enjoys living rent free in your head.

You don't want to hear this, and you're not going to believe me, because I know exactly how it feels. But unless you're totally cool with this behavior, and feeling awful and stressed out because you want her to forgive you, then you have to move on bro. I'm dead ass serious.

Tell her that you can't continue the relationship if she refuses to communicate. She will probably play it off like, okay, fine, let's break up. NO CONTACT, end the relationship, and she will probably be back in your DMs within 7 days trying to get your attention again. And then you'll probably take her back and the cycle continues.

For instance years ago I told a woman I loved her pants (they were tie-dyed jeans). Just turned into a conversation about tie-dye, the Oregon country fair. I asked to buy her a drink and we ended up seeing each other for a little bit. Showing you are interested in someone and what they have to think I feel is a lot more attractive than saying ""wow you are beautiful"" (although not everyone obviously). The easiest thing to start talking about is something you assume you have a common interest in. Although this also doesn't always work. I met a gorgeous woman a couple years ago and we ended up hitting it off and had a one night stand. It ended with me saying I loved her pink Floyd dress (she had a cute dark side of the moon dress) and she asked ""who?""

That was unfortunate because it seemed like we were connecting on music a lot more than anything else but it turned out she was kinda BSing the whole time about music. No hate on anyone who doesn't know Pink Floyd but it didn't work out for other reasons (mainly we were stupid drunk kids who were both horny)",1,0.954

Don't make a big deal out of it. Just a quick ""sorry"" or ""right"" upon being corrected and using the right pronoun from then on. There are definitely people who get all ragey about stuff like this, but most of us trans and genderqueer folk can tell the difference between an honest mistake and something hateful. Also, you're a lot less likely to get that intense reaction outside of Twitter/Tumblr and high school.

A good piece of advice that I use is to just say ""y'all"" instead of ""dude"" or ""girl"". The real issue is about taking any presumption of gender out of our language, which is difficult and will take time. Like, for me, I personally view ""dude"" as gender-neutral, but I know not everyone does, so I try to avoid it. I definitely still mess it up sometimes.

Most people will give you grace, but for those that don't, just know, as long as you're genuinely trying, their anger is about them, not you. Trauma fucks us up, and sometimes it causes some weird reactions. 

Also, do you have anxiety or OCD? I do, and I recognize that reaction of fear of interacting with people you don't want to upset. Just remember, you're afraid because you want to do the right thing, even if you don't know what it is. You should feel good about that, and know you will grow and learn if you try!",7,0.818

America isn't a Christian country. That's explicitly spelled out in the First Amendment. However, it *was* built around the assumption that the vast majority of people would ascribe to more or less the same moral code. The Founding Fathers didn't foresee that America would become so diverse. EDIT: To clarify, I'm not saying that diversity is a bad thing; I personally think it's a *very* good thing. I'm just saying that the Founding Fathers didn't consider the possibility.

*Parts* of the Republican Party are terrorist groups. The problem afflicting the GoP is that it's a hodgepodge of different viewpoints that are “conservative” as compared to the Democratic Party. As such, *laissez-faire* Capitalists are mixed up with Fascists (socialism + nationalism), National Socialists (democratic socialism + racism), Libertarians (capitalism but with weed and market regulations), Anarchists (“screw government; let's return to monkee”), and half a dozen other political theories.

However the one story that sticks in my mind the most is just a simple tale of art appreciation and self discovery. 

I was riding my bike across the playa at night and saw an optical illusion in the distance away from the crowds. It took me a lot longer to reach the illusion than I initially thought and it was far enough away from the noise/lights to really feel secluded. 

The art installation was simply some mirrors set up on a semi circle and some candles in the middle.

I sat in front of those mirrors and candles for who knows how long that night was with just reflections of myself and the desert around me.

Eventually another Burner saw the same illusion and relieved me of my post.

I hope they found as much meaning in that simple art as I did.

I have a couple more decades of wear and tear than you do, and have seen society change drastically over my lifetime. In many ways for the better,  I am not even a conservative. 

At this stage accumulated responsibilities are getting quite heavy and I admit I am just trying to keep my head above water. I barely have the bandwidth to keep track of where i put my dang car keys on any given day, let alone keep track of where the ultrawoke have most recently moved the goal posts to. It is not that i don't care and respect folks, i just dont read the memo every day, as i expect there will just be a new one tomorrow, and will simply ask then.

About a year ago I started the first “fixed schedule” job I have ever had. In my field it is not common at all. I was used to early days, late days, evenings, and weekends all rotating and blending together, and I was resigned to the fact that I just was not a great sleeper so I was tired during the day and used a lot of caffeine and energy drinks to function. 

Shortly after the schedule change I listened to a podcast that had some Dr that worked with ex Mil and current service members coming off combat deployments where their sleep schedule was super jacked up. He outlined some basic sleep hygiene and I kind of tried them… stop stimulants after lunch, no screens for an hour before bed, finding the right environment (temperature, light level, white noise, etc) to suit you, and finding out how much sleep you need. Basic stuff. 

I committed to it and my alarm is set for 6 but I am out of bed between 5/5:30 daily feeling good. I read a little each morning, do mobility stretching for my low back, and have the time to ease into my day. By the time I am at the office (8) I am mentally in the game and able to get shit done…meaning I am not chasing my production through the day and causing more stress…meaning I am not rushing to try and finish…meaning I am happy with my work and not bringing it home. All of that allows me to 1) NOT complain about stupid stuff and get spun up over it. and 2) not being stressed means not having to wind down… life is easier unstressed and 99% of it is self induced. 

Turn your screens off, get your sleep environment right for you, cut the caffeine off early, and allow yourself a week or so to settle into the routine that works well for you. 

I think the book was called “why we sleep” but I am not 100% and tbh I didn’t read it, I just listened to a Mil guy who this Dr helped and the Dr talk about sleep hygiene and a lot of Dr stuff about sleep and why it is necessary.",2,0.953

Scheduling a daily snack for when you wouldn't normally eat one can be  helpful, but in my experience, the easiest thing to do was to start drinking mass gainer. 

I tried different shakes, and the ones that were thick were still a struggle to force myself to eat. Then I found Optimum Nutrition Serious Mass, and it dissolves well in water and stays thin and watery, so drinking it wasn't a chore. A little pricey, sure, but so is all the extra food you now won't need to buy.

I like the chocolate one.

I think my metal journey started with power metal, and I used to scoff at the ""screamy"" kind. My favorite band there is probably Roy Khan-era Kamelot. 

Didn't take me long to shed my irrational fear of screaming and growling, and I think my next taste expansion went to melodic death metal, and Scar Symmetry is one of the first I really got into and is probably my favorite, especially with Christian Alvestäm on vocals, but unlike Kamelot who I think got pretty generic post-Roy I do like a lot of S.S.'s post-Alvestäm work. The 2 guys that replaced him (lmao) are both talented, and they've still got their other draw for me, Per Nilsson who IMO is one of the most talented guitarists around. He's really versatile too, he's also in old-school progressive rock band Kaipa now (Similar vein to Yes and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer. Good stuff.)

In the progressive metal/""djent"" realm, I think pioneers Periphery have top spot for me (although they themselves dispute that ""djent"" is really its own genre). All the members are so talented, weirdly the vocalist gives me an emo/pop punk vibe when he's clean singing but it works really well. Guitarist Misha Mansoor is also amazing. Another one of my favorite guitarists.

I don't really know what this sub-genre is really called, maybe ""math metal""? Think heavy syncopation, weird time signatures, and complex riffing, you all know what I mean and I think Meshuggah have that in the bags.

I also like a lot of metal fusions with other genres, like Eluvietie blending Celtic sounds with heavy metal, you've also got pirate/sea shanty metal masters Alestorm, and there's a few bands blending electronica and metal, and I think my favorite there might be obscure Japanese band Blood Stain Child. Definitely worth checking out.

I also have some notable mentions: For power metal I've also been into Stradivarius, Helloween, Gamma Ray, Nightwish, Avantasia, Galneryus, Sonata Arctica, Seventh Wonder (The vocalist for them is now also the lead vocalist for Kamelot after Roy Khan left. I like him better in Seventh Wonder tho) etc. There are some other good melodic death metal bands, like In Flames, Soilwork, Solution .45 (One of Christian Alvestäm's current bands) and this short-lived band out of Russia I found on Facebook way back called Instant Suppression. It's a shame they didn't stick around long and get bigger, they had an awesome sound and used really cool industrial and sci-fi synths almost crossing into that electronica/metal fusion thing. There's also a German band called Deadlock who I've liked for a while, musically I guess you could say they're melodic death metal, or maybe metalcore, but lyrically carry a lot of environmentalist and animal welfare themes, and I think all the members are vegan. They have an interesting dynamic that I like where they have a male harsh vocalist that transitions into soaring sections or the chorus with clean, sweet-sounding female vocals. There's definitely more I missed but yeah, couldn't pick just one!",1,0.998

I may still have to take the new shift, as options are limited otherwise. What most of my friends and family have never understood is that I've pretty much always worked 2 or more jobs since I was about 20.

""Dreams have meaning"" 

There is no karma. No universal justice. Sometimes great things happen to terrible people and they get away with it.

There is no positive or negative energy. Our moods shift all the time and that's healthy. Trying to be positive so the time and neglecting your 'negative energy' is toxic and damaging.

Dreams can have meaning, like if you're dealing with poor mental health and you're scared/worried/ashamed/etc of something. That's just our brains trying to process shit.
Otherwise no, Vanessa, dreaming of a toaster does not mean by bread will be blessed and I'll win the lottery next month. 

Have you ever looked up the meaning of something and been told something terrible will happen? No. It's always something good and that's how you know it's bs. 

I'm very particularly angry at certain spirituality and if that means my third eye has pinkeye and I'm not going to ascend then that's fine by me. I'm sick of hearing about it and it's everywhere.

Granted I think the majority of people overall don't care.  But if even 99% of the population don't hate LGBTQ+ folks, 1% is still a LOT of people and it makes life fucked up for us.  
As a trans woman, I think most people couldn't give a shit.  Most folks, conservative or liberal, are like ""Huh okay whatever."" The problem is the ones that do care are enough that going to the grocery store without being harassed, getting employed and working without someone throwing a fit, etc are difficult.  I walk past 200 people in the store, if even 1% have a problem with me, going grocery shopping is going to suck.  
And even though most people don't care, we still get stuff like Mississippi's law saying I can be evicted or denied housing for being trans.  Or I can be fired for being trans.  Right now there's several states that are banning doctor recommended treatments for transgender kids and Florida is proposing extending that to adults too.

One time in second grade we had to go to the computer lab to do a two-hour standardized test on the computers. Keep in mind this was in the mid 2000s, long before computers in the classroom became normal. We usually only did one 30-minute computer session a week at the computer lab. Standardized testing is stupid as is, but it was ridiculous to ask seven year olds to take a serious two hour test on a computer and expect something good to come out of it.

I stood up for two minutes because I had excess energy (I have ADHD) and didn’t want to interrupt the test. My plan was to ask to go outside in the hall and do some jumping jacks and stretches. My teacher went up to ask me why I was standing and I told her I wanted to take a break because I had a hard time sitting down. She then proceeded to jump on me, wrap her arms around my waist and we both fell to the floor, my 70 pound self below her overweight 160 pound body. 

I started screaming and panicking and she told me she wouldn’t get off of me unless I calmed down. How was I supposed to calm down when someone more than twice my size was attacking me? She had restrained me a few times before when I was acting up, but this time she lay on top of me and the whole class saw me. Throughout the year she also repeatedly called me retarted and bullied me for having special accommodations (I was in both OT and speech therapy) by alienating me from the class and announcing any fault I had. 

The most fucked up part was that while my parents tried to get the administration to fire her, there wasn’t much they could do because she had tenure. Last thing I heard she’s still teaching 15 years later and is loved by most students because she only treats the “problem children” like deranged animals, and she usually doesn’t get kids with accommodations. The year I had her was the last year she had a classroom with kids who have IEP’s, of which I was the only one in class that year to have one.",12,-0.959

Seriously, the money he has left is there to provide a pension and to ensure he won't die owing medical debt - he's specified that in his living will (and to cut off life support before the money runs out), and the last of that money will be donated when he dies. If he could pre-plan all his expenses, he'd have $0 before he died.

You try committing to something like that. Start donating.",5,0.275

China can't go back to normal because their vaccine doesn't work against Omicron and their vaccination rate is really bad especially in the most vulnerable populations.  If they let Omicron rip through the country, everything will collapse.  Wuhan and Italy from early 2020 will seem quaint in comparison.  That's why they're trying to contain it so hard.

edit:

A lot of you are surprised by this but it's true. Many child prodigies don't stay that way. Many plateau and eventually are caught up by their peers as really all they have done is master a skill/field of study quickly. It's impressive when they're very young but when they grow up they really haven't developed further than that and are left behind in many ways socially and sometimes economically. They tend to be under extreme pressure to succeed and do great things while also having very little in common with both their older educated peers and younger same-aged kids. This leaves them to be very awkward and socially outcasted even as adults. Even worse, it's actually not that common for a child prodigy to be genuinely creative in their chosen field of accelerated learning. They don't really grow and discover after reaching their peak and so they don't meet those expectations of ""greatness"" as they slowly get older and become just some person who is good at a particular skill/subject like plenty of other educated people who went the regular route. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying it's all doom and gloom for them as there are plenty of practical advantages to be that far ahead when you're young.

The CCP isn’t doing anything particularly new. It’s crucial to recognise that if one wishes to understand Chinese mentality and why the Chinese people put up with a government like this. 

The general problem with the west’s understanding of China is only looking at China from the perspective of modern history. From a view shaped by a history of Roman republicanism and secular enlightenment and the resulting individualism that China never had. 

It’s why western rulers keep hitting walls with the CCP and why the general public/news have trouble understanding Chinese mentality. I always hear people in the west say “I’m sure the Chinese people will rise up and want to fight for their own freedom soon” when that’s never been the reason the Chinese populous have risen up against their rulers. There’s no tradition of individual freedoms or any of these western values in the traditional Chinese psyche. People only ever disturbed their lives if it became impossible to scrape out a truly basic living. And so long as people had basic food and shelter, no one really cared about individual freedoms.

The difference is primarily in playstyle. Some weapons and ashes require/scale off one or the other. It would be less tedious to figure out what you like to do or which weapons or spells you’d prefer to use prior to fully devoting to either one. Ultimately though, you could do both! There is a seal and a staff that scale off both FTH and INT with a higher raw total than other options, albeit for a much higher level investment. Style-wise, both stats can operate as spellswords, distance casters, boss busters, etc. and only differ visually (with small deviations in maximum range). 

STR/DEX: these will largely affect your ability to defend yourself sans-FP, but DEX will also affect your ability to cast more quickly. Again I recommend figuring out what weapon or weapons you enjoy using and which stats they scale with. One is only superior to the other relative to your weapon and playstyle. 

Arcane is an oddball stat useful only when paired with ARC scaling weapons, bleed builds, or ARC-enabled spells. You can largely ignore it unless you want access to those spells, abilities, weapons. If you like the Dragon Communion incantations, however, I recommend investing heavily into ARC and FTH with the Dragon Communion seal (this will change the incant scaling from primarily FTH to primarily ARC and boost communion incantations). 

As for starting class, don’t worry about it. Class affects your early game, starting gear, and min-maxing. That’s it.",1,0.837

Fire’s Deadly Sin + Dark Moon Greatsword pair well. Basically the DMGS ash of war + charged heavy attack should proc FB almost immediately on things that don’t resist it. FDS ticks for fire damage up close and should reset the frost buildup, allowing DMGS to do its job again right away. 

For this you need enough STR/INT to wield and pull the bulk of your damage with DMGS, but you’ll also need enough FTH to cast FDS with an offhand seal. Pairing INT and FTH will also let you cast magma spells with a staff if that suits your aesthetic here. You can also find several frost spells throughout the game to compliment the whole thing. 

Your choice of staff/seal is entirely preference, but for the lowest entry cost Meteorite will do the job. You’d only be using it in cases where DMGS wouldn’t work anyway. Late game, however, almost any other staff at or nearly maxed is better. For the seal I would stick with whatever you have stats for (you don’t really even need to power it up unless there’s an offensive incantation you want to use as ranged filler). If you go full INT/FTH split, though, I recommend the Golden Order seal and Prince of Death Staff.",2,-0.978

For the second phase I just did the same thing, but I learned you really have to be patient and learn the fire magic patterns. It can be very deceptive. I mostly just ate his roll over attack because it's very hard to dodge, which is doable with your hp at or near full for sure. I think you can get iframes but it's just a huge attack box so it's not worth fussing over missing a dodge. The Physical and fire protection talismans helped me a lot, and you can even add pearldrake for even more fire protection if you have it. Stamina Regen talisman/turtle shield also helped me a ton here because of how mobile the fight is.

The can opener thing was something I was really struggling with and after breaking several $5 grocery store can openers, I had a meltdown on facebook about it and a couple of different people recommended that one to me. It was tough for me to follow their advice because the one thing about buying expensive household items is that mayyyyybe it's expensive because it's well built or mayyyyyyybe it's just expensive because rich people don't know how much a can opener is supposed to cost. I'd already been through that with some stuff like hand soap pumps*, in particular. But the OXO can opener has been totally worth it for me. A good investment. 

*(I kept buying these hand soap pumps from like Target or wherever that would get gummed up with soap or break when they fell on the floor. Someone had to tell me to just re-use the little ones that you get at the supermarket. Might seem obvious to some, but I had presumed that the expense would mean they were higher quality).",3,0.954

I thought the “player should die about 10 times so the victory feels meaningful” was a good articulation of the design philosophy but if you reject that then what do you think it is? “Can be beaten” is pretty subjective, I mean the developer could make a boss that requires frame perfect dodges every time which technically can be beaten. Just to clarify my position, I do think that any inclusion of an “easy mode” should also include a hard mode in addition to standard difficulty because it seems to me they have the same conundrum for veteran players on the other end of the spectrum.

The thing is objections to variable difficulty often reek of “only cool real Gamers get to play this game” kind of mentality though I don’t mean to accuse you in particular of doing that.",1,-0.705

There are no volatiles except for in a beginning cutscene and at the very end, unless you go into dark zones, but if you only go in them at night like the game tells you to, you'll never see them. So nighttime is a joke. The game shouldn't even be called Dying Light anymore. It should be called Walking on Sunshine: Cakewalk Edition.

Garrus makes more sense, because when you meet him, he's actively proving himself a valuable asset to C-Sec, but Wrex was basically just doing thug shit on the citadel.

I think the biggest problem with 3 is the lack of any of your decisions having any actual final impact on the story. At best, they change some cutscenes here and there, but most of the time, all they matter is points on a bar graph, that, to add insult to injury, doesn't actually matter.",1,-0.83

Pokemon are actually small gods, Yokai and Kami- Ponyta is a firey horse spirit, not an actual pony. The issue is the manga/anime and later games obfuscate this point because of course, pokemon are used 1:1 with real world animals- we farm Tauros and Miltanks, we hatch eggs from Chicken-ish pokemon, etc.

But you've still got pokemon that embody Onmyodo concepts- here's a pokemon that's a childhood toy that was loved enough/thrown away enough to develop it's own spirit, Pokemon that are ayakashi and Mononoke,  spirits of the dead or spirits that represent strong feelings, and pokemon that explicitly change their nature and abilities depending on where they ""anchor"" themselves. Animal pokemon are just guardian spirits that appear whenever there's a great amount  of animals of that type, whereas Muk represent the spirit of pollution itself within the city.

So Pokemon Legends is just reversing the premise- if modern-day Pokemon is high tech mysticism, then historical pokemon is an affair with Abe No Seimei and onmyoji using revered techniques.sical bodies, and a summoner, much like a modern-day Trainer, captures them with paper and other tools, tames them into obedience, then summons them as servants and guardians.

Pokemon is like a postmodern take on it- tech has improved to the point anybody can capture and tame Yokai, they can be digitized and sent through the internet, and the great spiritual powers of literal gods can be contained by a mass-produced ball sold relatively cheaply at your local convenience store.

It wasn't until It came out for PC, and I watched a few streamers play through some parts and realized the hordes weren't as prevalent as I thought that I got it on a steam sale for like 25$ or something. If I recall correctly as well, The game came out on the tail end of ""Every game has to have/be about zombies"" Era after the peak of The Walking Dead infamy. Furthermore, I think even the studio has claimed (Correctly) that its advertising was absolute garbage by Sony which aided in it not really getting the credit/chance it deserved.",1,0.933

Same goes for the one in the bottom, it feels very orange but because there's a reflection highlight on top of it, which is usually a plus (additive) operation. It goes to almost yellow ish. But still sticks to obviously orange.( I know this because I composite vfx for a living at a big studio, so I am definitely not colorblind haha)

I think it's difficult to be super certain about the colors in this vid and to start fighting about them.

I don't think anyone here is colorblind but it's just a treacherous angle to look at in the video and the player actually did win. And it's safe to say that the 'winner' isn't colorblind either because both orange and red would be different shades for a colorblind person.",4,0.979

My suggestion to further encourage and develop skill is to invest in some dedicated lighting, (the shifting shadows in each picture detract from the otherwise well done stop motion). Dedicated and even lighting will go a long way to fixing that.
Next I suggest a rock solid tripod and holder for the camera, with shot bags to weigh it down to make sure it is rock solid and doesn't move. There is some minor shifting of the camera between shots from what I can see. A remote trigger for the camera too so you can take frames without touching the camera and potentially moving it.
Next work on sound design to further the narrative. You don't necessarily need dialog. Even just suitable ambience goes a long way, and you have the makings of a great piece.

Good work, keep it up.",3,0.971

Which is why I wrote ""probably do a better job with digital"". 4K is around 8mpixel. A GoPro (while far from a perfect camera) is smaller and does 20mpixel. I don't know much about small cameras but you'd be able to fit in a decent RAW camera that can do over 8 mega pixels surely. The benefits of digital would far out way the analogue ones if you're talking technical terms. You'd be able to shoot more shots, trigger with things like bluetooth or whatever, view your shots on location, edit your shots on location if needed...etc. As for editing, its much quicker to add some film emulation than it is to develop and scan film. 

While its incredibly cool, unique and I love it, no one is strapping a 35mm camera to a drone because they think that's the best way to do drone photography.",1,0.982

But reading much of the comments here confirms what I expected: People don't understand the benefit to actual film over digital.

Digital is way more convenient for myriad reasons, which is why even professionals seldom bother with film anymore, but not because digital is better- it's just ""good enough"" that 9 out of 10 times no one cares (and it IS a hassle).All these ""but why if drones have cameras"" are exactly what I hear on a daily basis.

Chicken is my only meat. And I agree it would be better to go full vegan.

I’ve gone vegan multiple times, including a span of several years, but I had a hard time staying healthy and satiated. I only like tofu if it’s prepared in a way that makes it unhealthy—if it’s not deep fried and served with some sugary sauce, it has a very strong taste and weird texture. Seitan is better, but is really rough on my digestion. Likewise with high-fiber protein sources like beans and other legumes. I like a lot of processed plant based proteins like Beyond, Impossible, or Gardein and usually go for those when they’re available, but they’re about as unhealthy as their meat equivalents. I always ended up eating a lot of processed food, gaining weight, and generally feeling unhealthy.

There’s just no vegan replacement for baked or grilled chicken breast that offers the same satiety, flavor, and macros. But as soon as lab-grown meat is comparably as available as slaughtered meat, I’m absolutely making the switch. Until then, I’m living with the fact that I’m living at the expense of other animals’ suffering. But I’m not happy about it.",2,0.857

I’d like to see support for that assertion. At least in the US, drivers can and do face criminal and civil penalties for injuring or killing people while driving.

&gt;	stop pretending like they are somehow improving the safety of those groups

I literally said that better separation between cyclists and cars would be ideal because cars are dangerous to cyclists. My point is that cyclists have to acknowledge and respect that cars are dangerous and ride accordingly if they’re going to share the road.",0,0.483

You may be a champion of industrialized, copy + paste images, plastered on low-quality t-shirts made by slaves. Or those NFT apes. Haven’t discerned which.

Who brought up “fairness”? No one has to like or buy your art. Even if you “industrialize”, still no one has to like or buy your art, no matter what the process is.

I don’t have to like a robot making my art as much as you don’t have to like what I do by hand.

Expect to hear what, exactly? That art could be more efficiently done with computers? Like, sorry, but no shit. Might there be reasons someone chooses to do art by hand instead of “industrializing”?

Whenever there is a surge, shut down, or even plug in the line, (natural gas can carry a lot of liquid in it, which condenses and freezes in the winter), that gas still has to go somewhere. So they installed flares that allow for the excess gas to be burned in a way that's safer than just venting it into the atmosphere. I think the only downside is that you need a pilot light going at all times to ensure that it'll be ready to go when a surge happens, but even older wells seem to get those maybe once a minute, so its not a rare occurrence. I'm pretty sure that if they just built the pipelines to accommodate those surges to begin with, it would be less efficient and cause way more issues. So basically it's a physics issue that necessitates the need to vent/flare off the excess gas.",53,0.986

I've been in this industry long enough to see the backlash when digital first was a thing (and considered consumer only) and how it slowly got ""good enough to compete"" with the gold standard that is film.

You want to copy + paste everything? I’d rather be a “starving artist” than mass produce garbage. 

I didn’t realize that art came all down to a time “investment”. 

You know, some artists just make art for the sake of expression and don’t just mass produce things for a dollar. Even if artists do produce art purely for money, it might help if people paid them for their time invested. 

Maybe you can start a hashtag about paying artists and one to stop asking for free stuff if you believe in the cause so much.",1,0.5

When I was a kid in Romania, my job was as cowpoke during the summer in the country. We had 1 cow that I'd take out to pasture twice daily from July to September.

Other than milk we'd also have a calf every year, which would be ready to kill and sell in the summer months.

One day when we were walking home for lunch, the cow stopped walking and looked to our house, some distance away down the road. Then she started walking faster, and I could barely keep up with her.

I thought she was trying to run away and I was kind of worried, because that would actually happen sometimes to people, cows would randomly run away. Usually to water, but still kinda scary.

But no, our cow trotted into our yard, to the back yard, and straight to the spot where her baby was slaughtered (the blood was visible on the ground).

And I swear that I saw her crying.

Why I'm not a vegan after that experience, I'll never know and it's maybe the problem with this world, but I love me some steak boy.",2,-0.894

&gt; 
&gt; Digital is way more convenient for myriad reasons, which is why even professionals seldom bother with film anymore, but not because digital is better- it's just ""good enough"" that 9 out of 10 times no one cares (and it IS a hassle).All these ""but why if drones have cameras"" are exactly what I hear on a daily basis. It's like someone asking why I spent $1000 on a new Zeiss glass element when I can buy a new iPhone with a ""better camera built in"". <U+0001F937><U+200D><U+2642><U+FE0F> Marketing and buzzwords are a helluvathing.

I don’t know where you’re from, but that is definitely not a colloquialism around here.

It only diminishes my argument because you are having difficulties navigating around the idea that I pointed out that it kinda sounds sexual in nature.

The only thing that keeps me from making money on hand-cut work is that people don’t want to pay for it. Period. Like I said, I learned the hard way that people love it and they just want it for free. It only took me a few times getting stiffed to start asking people money for materials up front. Once they realize how much the materials cost, suddenly they don’t want it (or they do and also pay you for your labor). 

I don’t know exactly where in the construction realm you lie, but I’m sure you’ve had people try to talk you down in price. Even *after* they’ve agreed to it. Even after the labor has begun. It can be as dumb as collecting rocks from a quarry and the client will say, “But they’re just rocks.” 

It’s a morality thing, I guess. The organic nature of my being. That’s the one part of my being that I am not going to allow a machine to dictate.

That means that in Brazil, no one gets “life” in prison, nor anything resembling it. Why? Well, if someone is 25 years old and commits a crime and that crime gets them 120 years in prison, then that’s no different than getting life. If it’s long enough to be considered life then that makes it “of a perpetual character”.
&gt;
&gt; The Brazilian Penal Code (article 75) says, in gist, “the maximum prison sentence can’t be longer than 30 years and, if so, the sentences should be combined and made no longer than 30 years.” The Penal Code was created in 1940 by then-President Getúlio Vargas and, at that time, the average life span of a Brazilian was about 43 years. Creating a 30-year maximum sentence was, with twisted irony (considering the Constitution), basically enprisonment for life at the time. Today, despite the actual expectancy being over 70 years of age, the original law was never updated.

Cocaine is not the same as heroin or fentanyl. It's addictive properties are much milder and is used a lot more recreationally and reasonably than the typical street drug. I would never consider selling those other things, because that is where the real societal harm is, not cocaine and  cannabis.

&gt;Now you've got a big wad of cash whose origins you can't explain.

You don't explain it. Obviously you don't spend it all at once. A few hundred or a thousand a month used to offset your food/fuel purchases while your saved money gets invested. Another route is buying crypto locally with cash (there are routes to in most cities), and then you can simply report your crypto as capital gains and pay tax on 50% of it. Or you can buy gift cards with cash and then convert them to crypto, many online resources for that. Congrats, you've now laundered money safely. 

(Also, a lot of things you buy in life can often be paid directly with cash, avoiding the transaction being traced. Obviously you wouldn't want to buy a house or a new car directly with it though)

&gt;You're willing to get arrested and charged for even a minor infraction?

Buying a bit of weed from a dealer is not going to affect your life much in this day and age, and usually dealers found through friend connections aren't going to be sting operations lmao, those are extremely rare. The benefit the money from this cocaine would have on your life far outweighs the negatives of a minor drug purchase.

They were dark times. But there was a prophecy of a greater power a siege engine capable of flinging 90kg projectiles over 300 meters.  Most said it was but a myth. Then in roughly the 1100s the the mighty counter weighted trebuchet was discovered.  Roaming the plains of France these mighty siege engines with their stout oaken frames were capable of doing exactly as the prophecy foretold. The people rejoiced as they were finally capable of taking the cities of their enemies.  The power of the trebuchet could not be matched and the great leaders were afraid.  They spread lies that catapults were better and even invented flashy useless weapons like cannons.  The people were deceived but we know the truth: The Trebuchet capable of flinging 90kg projectiles over 300 meters is the superior siege engine.",5,0.974

China and Russia can't project an invasion force to Canadian soil so there's really no alternative.

when i finally got a proper diagnosis, the doctor that did so gave me a script for what was then a brand new medication called oxycontin- time-release oxycodone. after taking it, the way i described it to the doctor was that i hadn't realized just how much pain i was actually in, until i got the opiates. the pain had been building up slowly all thru my 20's, and it just felt ""normal"" to me...kind of like how you can supposedly slowly heat water to boiling with a frog in it, and they won't notice it happening. i was also working as a concrete construction laborer, spend large chunks of most days hunched over, shoveling wet concrete, so it was easy to blame the hurting on the job, and self-medicate with copious amounts of  alcohol, weed, and otc ibuprofen.

but- i don't understand the hesitancy about prescribing it either. i have been taking methadone daily for 25+ years, with no problems on my part. i gave up alcohol, but i do use cannabis. i had to go to a methadone clinic for heroin addicts to get (expensively)dosed for several years, and they had no problem with cannabis use...they practically encouraged it. 

my current dose is 80mg/day, although a fresh round of self-titration has shown that i should be on 120, but the doctor refuses to increase my dosage. it is extremely frustrating. and **very** painful.",2,-0.785

Its not. Gender/Race swapping existing characters damages the viewers enjoyment just the same as writing their personality to be different.

Imagine your favorite TV show in 15 years getting a reboot, but the main character is now the bad guy, the bad guy is now the oppressed good guy, and that side character you loved? They look and act absolutely nothing like what you loved. Is that a show worthy of the name of the show you loved from 15 years ago? Its not difficult. Write a new character in, and write them well. Make it seamless. Good diversity means people dont notice it. Good diversity is natural and feels like it belongs.

This also means taking context into account. Do I expect to see movies taking place in China that have a bunch of whites, hispanics, blacks, etc? No, because the context is that its in China, I would expect a majority of actors to be asian. Unless its some kind of satirical comedy, but again, context. Or in a WWII film, I am not going to expect there to be black germans on the battlefield. Forced diversity is kind of the same thing.",1,0.958

Sure, that's easy. A mixed economy. Which is what pretty much every western nation is. A balance of regulations and freedoms that balance the social cost to benefit of private businesses. Takes on many different forms but that's a pretty universal constant at this point. Think about it this way, 

Microeconomics - ""why government intervention is bad""  
Macroeconomics - ""why government intervention is necessary""

Really you are just describing a market economy. However, if you cannot recognize that the system you are in has tradeoffs that is, in fact, dumb. Also, capitalism is mostly reducing upfront costs of ownership by improving liquidity to businesses for a specified rate of interest over a period of time. You can absolutely have a market economy without explicit private lenders. They are just efficient because banks and lenders can manage their risk more effectively than say a centralized government. Capitalism is not an exclusive need for a market economy though.",1,0.931

The Wheel of Time (Amazon Prime) had sort of shoehorned inclusivity, and didn’t focus enough on the show’s quality.  Ended up hating it.  So, I get the viewpoint, but don’t make it seem like inclusivity = bad content, just because you don’t like seeing people of other ethnicities and non-hetero sexualities featured in shows and movies.  I’m sure there’s plenty of poor content that has a mainly white straight male cast.

He doesn't have the resources. Noone has the resources.

World Hunger gets worse and worse. African countries do not develop fast enough to deal with their massive overpopulation and population growth. 

The primary drive of Hunger in Africa is overpopulation. ( Africa's population now is 1.4 billion, in 80 years it will be close to 5 billion. 

1. Nigeria had a population of 15 million in 1900. It had a population of 120 million in 2000, and now it has a population of 206 million. In 2050 it wil be 400 million. In 2100 it will be 800 million ( Nigeria will be the second largest country in 2100, China will drop to roughly 750 million, and India will to 1.3 billion ). Many other African countries are similar. The average Median age is 19 in Africa, which means half the population is BELOW the age of 19, the other Above. Nigeria's Median age is even 18. ( in other words, 103 million people aged 0-18 )....  
To nobody's surprise Hunger gets progressively worse in Nigeria. 27 million people are suffering from Hunger in West Africa ( stand April 2022 ), the majority in Nigeria... Until June this number will rise to 38 million.   
Nigeria doesn't have a drought, it doesn't have a civil war and nothing... It's purely lack of infrastructure, agriculture and whatnot. 
2. Congo.   
1900 : 9 million people. 2000 : 47 million. Today : 90 million. 2100 : 250 million.   
In Congo 27 million people ( stand december 2021 ) are at risk of starvation. 1 million children are acutely malnurished and will definetly suffer from these affects for the rest of their life, if they live. Hunger affects 47% of the population. Congo doesn't have a civil war, it doesn't have any droughts or harvest failures, and yet it has the worst hunger crisis in the world... In 2017, merely 7 million people were at risk of starvation. In 2021 it was 20 million. 

How can anyone fix it ? 

1. Get rid of corruption.
2. Create a sustainable population growth ( i.e. stagnation or population decline ). Not this 6% population growth which these countries suffer from. 
3. Fix the economy. 
4. Update infrastructure ( not merely transport, but also water and food infrastructure ). 
5. If present, get rid of warlords and war
6. Fix the climate ---&gt; No more flooding, droughts, crop failures... 

Yes Elon Musk, you billionaire can surely fix about a couple of countries because as everyone knows you just need to throw a few billions of dollars at a problem and it will fix itself, right ? 

Even if he sends $6 billion worth of food to some African countries ( it wont even be enough to feed the entire continent of Africa for a year ), then what ? Most of it wont even reach those at risk of starvation. 80% of it will get sold by corrupt officials and/or warlords ( Which is exactly what happened... An article from 1992 : [https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-08-15-mn-4871-story.html](https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1992-08-15-mn-4871-story.html) ) ...

So for Elon to successfully make sure his food gets to the people... He needs to hire mercenaries and invade a few countries to make sure the both the workers distributing food and the food itself are safe. He needs to get rid of most warlords to make sure they aren't a problem. Likewise he needs to overthrow a few governments which are too corrupt. He should install himself as ruler of some African countries in order to fix the infrastructure, corruption, economy and climate. He needs to deal with massive overpopulation, that's such a complicated issue and the population growth is completely unmanagable by any African country ( most African countries doubled their population in the last 20 years, and the population will continue to grow ).... Bill Gates decided to tackle this problem you know ? A high child mortality is tied to higher population growth, so Gates decided to sponsor massive vaccination campaigns to get rid of a few diseases... Still this had barely an impact, and he is now known in conspiracy circles as someone who creates devious vaccines. But it's not merely diseases which lead to high child mortality... It's also violence, crime and cultural reasons...

Our barn, and his lair was a good hundred yards from the house, but if he saw you simply existing in the yard he would full sprint the entire distance to maul you. He used to patrol the house, peering in to the ground floor windows and would attack them if a living being could be seen inside. My bedroom was in the basement, and on many occasions I woke up to the sight of him watching me sleep. 20 years later the scratches on the windows are all that remains of his reign of terror. He would often hide in a bush at the front door, just waiting for someone to leave the safety of the house. The neighborhood kids used to all come over, (many had roosters of their own but none could match Turkey Lurkey's speed or ferocity, so he became a bit of a neighborhood legend among us children) and we would line up, Civil War style and March into battle against him. He would attack and we would scatter, hoping not to fall prey to his velociraptor like spurs he loved to stab us with. My sister was probably 8 or so at the time, and could be easily tripped to appease his blood lust.

I swear he would lay traps too, he reminded me so much of the raptors from Jurassic Park. We had a boat in the barn, covered up, and a ladder that went up to the hay mow next to it. We once ventured out there, searching for him, but he was no where to be found. I quietly climbed the ladder, hoping to spot the beast. Half way up the ladder the hair on the back of my neck stood on end as I realized the tarp over the boat was rustling. This would be my ""clever girl"" moment, as I slowly turned to look over my shoulder to find myself at eye level with the local ecosystems most apex predator. Before I could climb down he was on my shoulders, slashing at my face as the other children ran in terror. I had fallen into his trap, and jumped from the ladder - my 10 year old brain remembers it was a good ten feet - and ran for my life.
The only life form he would not attack was my father, and that was only becuase he used to take a pitching wedge with him to tend to the garden because of Turkey Lurkey. I once watched my dad send him sailing back into his pen with it, and he took dad off the hitlist after that. He once went over to the nighbors yard and beat up their pitbull. He was truly an evil creature, but he was so much fun to have around.

Eventually he attempted to annex a different neighbors property into his own, and in doing so mauled two young children. My father took him to the country and left him. I assume his death was glorious, similar to the scene in Alien VS Predator where the predator fights endless waves of aliens until finally being over run, just he was fighting pack after pack of coyotes.",43,-0.939

Everyone in my department was a woman for the majority of that time, and a large group of us were in our early twenties so we got along really well. I later described it as banding together through hell lol

We'd have a lot of regular customers that would order weekly or at least very frequently, so we would get familiar with either their order, or the person/people who came to pick them up. Sometimes one of us would have a bad experience with a customer and would refuse to take that person's orders out anymore, and we respected that. Even if it was our turn to be bringing the orders outside to customers, someone else would help out and bring the order out instead. I think most of us that had been there more than 6 months had at least 1 person like that, or that we would at least like to avoid taking out their order if possible for various reasons.

I don't know how this started, but one of the girls got into a verbal fight with a customer that escalated to the lady saying she was going to jump the girl (completely uncalled for over groceries). My department manager tried to get her banned from using our service or at least at our store but there really was no way of blocking her out of the system. We didn't see her again for another 8-12 months at least, but the girl was still working there and understandably refused to take out her orders. All of us knew who she was and what she did, and would tell new people about what happened when we took out her orders. We would always have to send out our nicest, friendliest girls with her orders, which sometimes ended up being me.

Looks like the standard was changed due to the reference cigarette no longer being available (unfiltered pall mall) https://www.cpsc.gov/Regulations-Laws--Standards/Rulemaking/Final-and-Proposed-Rules/Flammability-of-Mattresses-and-Mattress-Pads

The standard sets forth a test to determine the ignition resistance of a mattress or mattress pad when exposed to a lighted cigarette. Lighted cigarettes are placed at specified locations on the surface of a mattress (or mattress pad). The Standard establishes pass/fail criteria for the tests. Until the amendment that passed in 2011, the standard specified the ignition source for these tests by its physical properties. These properties were originally selected to represent an unfiltered Pall Mall cigarette, which was identified as the most severe smoldering ignition source.


CPSC amended the standard for the flammability of mattresses and mattress pads to revise the ignition source specification in that standard. The ignition source cigarette specified for use in the mattress standard's performance tests is no longer produced. The Commission is requiring a standard reference material cigarette, which was developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, as the ignition source for testing to the mattress standard.",5,-0.624

* In his early career he was hired for both his acting skills and his writing skills. He would write and define his characters which he really enjoyed. His character in Ghostbusters was basically his own creation and writing. By the time the 1990s rolled around he had less creative control. I think he mentions a movie where he wanted to modify his characters dialogue and was shot down. Might have been Parenthood.
* He felt he was being typecast by the 1990s.
* He really enjoyed being onset. He talked about spending time with the other actors and enjoying the downtime during filming. He mentions the time he really enjoyed with Steve Martin. In his later films the productions were on tight budgets and downtime was very limited.
* He does mention being a single father but keep in mind that his wife passed in 1991 and he was still acting into the later 90s. I still believe it played a major factor into his decision but based on the interview it wasn't the sole reason.



At the very end he mentions how he stopped enjoying acting and after leaving the industry for a few years he realized he just didn't miss it. He did mention that he still receives scripts and almost signed onto one years ago but it required him to go to New Mexico for like twelve weeks in the middle of nowhere and he passed.

It would be nice to be able to separate out the private lives of actors from their movies but when they are jerks IRL or propagate sketchy belief systems (and now, tragically, I need to add Will Smith to that list) it really spoils my enjoyment.

The other component that grates on me now is the propoganda angle.  I grew up loving war movies and shooting guns and doing all that stuff.   But Top Gun was a pure sales job for the US military.  I used to really enjoy watching NCIS too but there are just too many scenes where they are hunting down the terrorist of the week, and then throwing their legal books out the window in their pursuit of the case because, you know, we're the good guys.

I'm not saying it's wrong for people to enjoy that sort of thing, but given the immense power of popular media, I am saying it's questionable to make and market products that are effectively psyops.

Everyone is quick to condemn Russia for their propoganda but we ought to be just as aware of its existence in our own backyard.

One of the most interesting and depressing developments in recent times has been the way that the very idea of whistle blowing has been stigmatised from all directions. 

Putting aside for a moment the cases that are murky -where leaks may have arguably put lives at risk - the sad reality is that our public institutions are rife with incompetence, greed, self interest and corruption.  The people who see this and want to see it put right should be seen as heroes.  This might seem to be a bit of a stretch since we were talking about Tom Cruise and Scientology,  but in my mind anyway, Hollywood can and does knowingly propogate messed up beliefs and morality, just like any religion.

* anxiety causes hero to smoke cigarrettes after not having smoked in years
* villain heirarchy - fodder, sergeants, lieutenants, boss. Hero fights them in that order.
* final fight with boss is long, drawn out, and usually 'mano a mano' fistfight. weapons will be tossed aside

* hero will be captured, held, and talked to by the villain at some point
* villain will leave the room, instructing his henchmen to ""take care of this"". They don't.
* hero's top sidekick has an apparent, non-explicit ""death"" - later comes back to help in crucial moment

sources, and its actual origin is unclear. The phrase has since been   
appropriated into other cultural contexts. For example, in the Star Trek franchise, it occurs several times as a Klingon saying, with Star Trek writer Marc Okrand proposing several ways to say the phrase in the Klingon language.\[1\] Starship Troopers 3: Marauder also features a patriotic song called by the phrase. In another example, a character in the anime Baki Hanma always says the phrase before a fight.

Though the majority of people who’ve seen it “like” the movie, they’re not nearly as passionate about their positive takes as people with negative opinions of the film are about theirs. You rarely see or hear anyone going to great lengths to describe its strengths, or what elements (besides the obvious, efx) stand out to them as being exceptional. 

You see the same lopsided, polarized reaction here. Public opinion almost seems represented by the comments in this thread: the majority of the negative ones so far are all about the same elements (plot, story being derivative or unoriginal, etc), but all those critical comments are heavily downvoted. Meanwhile, there really isn’t much actual praise or many positive angles in the comments; if anything those who don’t dislike the movie just seem neutral. It’s like the average person hates seeing the movie panned, but rarely defends it as being great…

It’s also kind of interesting that people write off the usual criticisms about the plot and such as being “lazy”, even though the prevalence of those takes arguably makes them valid. Even analysts largely credit the box office success of Avatar to the use of 3D and the quality of the CG effects in the movie, and the sequels are reportedly costing a total of 1billion to make specifically because of the technology behind them.",18,0.957

Another thing I liked is how his tools were, for the most part fairly rudimentary, in sync with his being fairly new at being the Batman. Like his wingsuit -- you notice he had to fiddle with it to get it to work and then it ended badly and he crash landed horribly. 

Also, during multi-opponent fights, he takes hits, from behind and the sides, enemies don't magically fade out till it's 'their turn', he takes big hits, gets knocked down, really seems to be struggling at times.

The Batmobile looked like a modded 70's muscle car. Nothing fancy. As BW, he drives around in about a '67 Vette. not a Ferrari. Great touches.

I know that a lot has been made of the underuse of Bryan Cranston, but from a plot and character point of view, his arc was done; he wanted to find out about his wife, and he did. His death was meant to motivate Aaron Taylor-Johnson to move forward and so carry the story. The problem is that Cranston's performance was the most interesting one, so while Taylor-Johnson wasn't really doing anything really 'bad' or 'wrong,' he just wasn't interesting enough to carry the movie.

This may be a controversial or unpopular opinion, but I think that *Godzilla '98* is actually a better movie than *Godzilla '14,* because its pacing is faster, its human characters are more interesting, and Godzilla is seen more often throughout the movie.",1,-0.936

List of James Cameron sequels:

* Piranha II
* Terminator 2
* Aliens
* Rambo II (co-writer only)
* Terminator: Dark Fate (story &amp; producer)

We'll give Piranha II a pass since it was his first feature and he wasn't really given any control of it.

T2 and Aliens are undoubtedly classics. They're among the best sequels ever made, for sure. But they were also over thirty years ago.

Meanwhile, Rambo II isn't an amazing movie, and calling Dark Fate a flop is putting it lightly. Yes, he didn't direct either of them, but they're still worth mentioning, and he was heavily involved with the Dark Fate development.

Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying Cameron isn't good at sequels or that this isn't going to be a strong movie. But calling him the best of all time with a data set of only two is a bit of a stretch. Especially when you look at the recent ones he's been involved with outside of directing.",45,0.936

I've got some downtime at the office so I'll just do my version of the whole thing. Just know I watched this the year it came out so a lot of the details in my mind are fuzzy. 

So scientists build a satellite on one of the mountaintops of Hawaii. This gets the attention of an alien race and they decide to invade. During this time there is a wargames event happening in Hawaii. Tons of battleships, aircraft carriers, destoryers, all top of the line all new and outfitted with fancy gagdets and guns, which we get to see basically 0 of. There may have been some celebrations/memorial relating to Pearl Harbor because there's a lot of old navy veterans in attendance (this becomes relevant later). The aliens land near Hawaii and erect a giant forcefield around the whole archipelago. The forcefield blocks all satelite, gps, and all manner of electronic transmission as well as blocking visuals. So people on the outside cannot see anything happening on the inside. The aliens are in things I would call spaceships but they never really leave the water so idk! But they're big and have massive weapons. Most of the fancy human ships are outside of this forcefield. Our main characters, of course, are inside. 

So the aliens just start blasting, pew pew! Human technology is no match! All but one ship is destroyed.  But oh no! It's night time! The forcefield is blocking all satellite and gps communications how will we aim our advanced rockets and weapons at an enemy we can't see or track?! So they figure out a way to track the wake of of these spaceships using wave data from buoys inside the forcefield (cuz I guess that works but other electronics dont???). Again, no idea why these advanced spaceships need to stay in the water other than ""so the movie can happen"". The buoys are conveniently in a grid pattern. So they use this grid pattern to determine where they're going to fire their big guns. It's very much a vibe of ""OH WE PLAYIN BATTLESHIP NOW BOIS"". Fire at grid B2! oh it's a miss! reposition guns, fire at C7! They blow up some of the alien ships! Wooo! But they're still no match for the aliens advanced weaponry and get demolished! The survivors of the destroyed ships try and collect themselves for a counter attack. They decide the best thing to do is to start by grabbing an old WW2 era battleship. But all the current serving military has no idea how to run a WW2 battleship, so they ask the old veterans for help. 

So, using a WW2 battleship, with a crew split between active duty persons and old army veterans, no advanced electronics, and barely anything more advanced than a PDC or 2 salvaged from the destroyed ships, the main characters somehow take on an advance alien race and FUCKING WIN.

One fact I remember being so appalled by was the fact that the advance alien ship had about the same maneuverability as a WW2 battleship. The main characters able to get the upper hand because this other ship isn't able to turn fast enough???

It's been a while since I watched it so much of the other bad logic that's sprinkled around I've forgotten about, but I remember watching it and kept thinking ""that's not how this works, that's not how anything works!""

Edit: I should add there's a side plot where other main characters encounter aliens on the Hawaiian island where the array is. I think they were trying to gain control of the array and use it to communicate with their homeworld but it was a really uninteresting aspect of the story. Big guns go PEW PEW.

It's a fairly *fun* movie. You'll be sitting there thinking this is so dumb, so why am I so pumped?! It hits all the buttons for a no-brain, big action, advanced aliens cgi kind of movie. [Here's a non-action clip that epitomizes the vibe of the movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zwVQ7M5IFt8). This is just after they get their asses handed to them by the aliens and are regrouping. the young and old getting a WW2 era battleship ready for battle with aliens. I mean look at this! These old veterans arrive like they're the fucking Avengers! So dumb! So Awesome!

Edit2: was reminded I had the events in the wrong order, rearranged to fit proper plot.",17,-0.984

I think a lot of the people who didn't enjoy it were looking for something like Conan or 300, while this movie has some great action scenes its a lot more drawn out like the Witch.

If I compared it to another movie I'd say its like a child between Valhalla Rising and the Witch. 

The story is simple enough but the themes of kindness vs revenge are portrayed very well and you can feel it. 

The scenery was a joy to look at, the music was atmospheric and beautiful. 

My favorite parts of this movie is when it shows Amleth as a berserker in the beginning, and later when he goes to look for the sword. Alexander skarsgaard has an impressive presence on screen and all the actors were really great in this. 

Well worth the money and I enjoyed every minute of this 2 hour movie.

Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.

Now, if the GOP had waited a bit and kept quiet about why they were removing Disney's status, they might have got away with it. They didn't.

They said that this law was specifically because of something that someone at Disney said. There have also been representatives who have gone on national television and said that if Disney took back what it said, issued a retraction, they would reinstate their special status as it was.

The state didn't remove Universal Studio's special protections. The law only punishes Disney, and they have openly declared it is because of something Disney said.

Kids found out about this and, needless to say, it was exploited heavily. Kids are very good at finding and abusing loopholes in the system. And this was a huge, obvious hole. Kids did a bunch of things, knowing that they wouldn't get punished more than perhaps a stern talking to. 

Thankfully, this has been reversed and the school is trying to clamp down on the problems that arose.

Generally because context of the word matters, the same reason any word has multiple definitions. Sex and gender are different, but colloquially “man/woman” and “male/female” are often used as interchangeable in daily speech. For example if you’re signing up for a new account on something, the tab that says “gender” usually has these options: “Male, Female, Other/Prefer not to say”. A lot of the time when people say “female” in generalized speech they’re not referring to people who have ovaries and a uterus and are typically capable of child birth etc etc, they’re talking about just a woman in general, or the general concept of “a woman”.

While simultaneously investing in technology that can remotely burn out nuclear warheads mid-flight, just in case the Dead Hand ISN'T a nasty piece of enemy scaremongering.

While lasers might seem like the more obvious solution to downing a nuclear missile, since light travels way faster than even a hypersonic missile, there is the small matter of blooming that impacts its efficacy over long distances. With that in mind, it'd probably be smarter to use some sort of finely-tuned neutron beam, since firing neutrons into fissile materials is how fission works.

Of course, **finely-tuned** is the watchword for remote defusal, since if the beam is strong enough to induce supercriticality, it'll explode with full force. But if it's too weak, it won't be able to burn off enough fissile material to render the warhead a proper dud. So the pulse would need to be tuned just right to turn the fission explosive into a melted lump of waste without actually setting it off.

Also, while neutron beams might sound like fantasy, they do actually exist in labs, and are being looked into for potential military applications. So in theory, if we wanted to de-fang a belligerent nuclear power, neutron beams could be the key.",1,-0.557

&gt; ###U.S. no longer in ‘full-blown’ pandemic phase, Fauci says  
&gt; **By Bryan Pietsch and Joel Achenbach**  
&gt; **Today at 5:32 a.m. EDT | Updated today at 11:00 a.m. EDT**
&gt; 
&gt; The United States is finally “out of the full-blown explosive pandemic phase” that has led to nearly 1 million deaths from covid-19 and more than two years of suffering and hardship, Anthony S. Fauci, President Biden’s chief medical adviser, said Wednesday.
&gt; 
&gt; “*We’re really in a transitional phase, from a deceleration of the numbers into hopefully a more controlled phase and endemicity,*” Fauci told The Washington Post.
&gt; 
&gt; Fauci’s comments came a day after he told PBS’s “NewsHour” that he believed the country is “out of the pandemic phase,” and he expanded on, and clarified, that view Wednesday, making clear that the pandemic is not over and the United States could still see an increase in coronavirus infections. But the virus is no longer causing the level of hospitalization and death seen in this country in previous waves of infection.
&gt; 
&gt; “*The world is still in a pandemic. There’s no doubt about that. Don’t anybody get any misinterpretation of that. We are still experiencing a pandemic,*” Fauci said.
&gt; 
&gt; He said the United States was in the “full-blown pandemic phase” in the winter, then entered a period he refers to as the “deceleration” phase. The country is transitioning, he said, to the control phase. That’s where he expects the health emergency to settle down, with the virus still circulating but not causing devastating new waves of hospitalization and death.
&gt; 
&gt; “*There’s the full-blown pandemic dynamic, the way we were months ago, where we were having 900,000 cases a day, tens of thousands of hospitalizations, three thousand deaths a day,*” he said. “*The deaths went from 3,000 down to 300.*”
&gt; 
&gt; Last May, Fauci said he thought the virus could reach the “control” stage by autumn. The delta variant soon rendered that impossible. Omicron then caused the biggest wave of cases yet.
&gt; 
&gt; New omicron sub-variants — BA.2 and BA.2.12.1 — have spread since, and are even more transmissible than previous strains, and nationally the case numbers are rising again, but so far there has not been a significant surge in hospitalizations.
&gt; 
&gt; “*Right now we’re at a low enough level that I believe that we’re transitioning into endemicity. … We’re not in the full-blown explosive pandemic phase. That does not mean that the pandemic is over,*” Fauci said. “*A pandemic means widespread infection throughout the world. … In our country we’re transitioning into more of a controlled endemicity.*”
&gt; 
&gt; Restrictions are easing as many Americans appear to be putting the pandemic behind them. Masking requirements have been lifted across most of the country, and officials stopped enforcing a federal mask mandate in transportation settings after a judge struck down the requirement.
&gt; 
&gt; During the pandemic’s darkest moments, many wondered when the country would be able to declare itself past the disaster, which has killed nearly 1 million Americans.
&gt; 
&gt; Fauci’s comments are likely to fuel debate about how the country should handle this moment. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Tuesday that as of the end of February, nearly 60 percent of Americans — including 3 out of every 4 children — have been infected with the coronavirus. But officials cautioned that the data did not indicate that Americans have widespread immunity against the virus because of their prior infections.
&gt; 
&gt; While previous infections are believed to offer some protection against serious disease for most people, health experts say the best protection against infection and serious disease or death is vaccination.
&gt; 
&gt; The coronavirus will not be eradicated, Fauci told PBS, but can be handled if its level of spread is kept “very low” and people are “intermittently” vaccinated, though he said he did not know how frequently that would have to happen. And he echoed warnings from the World Health Organization and the United Nations this month that worldwide, the pandemic is far from over as vaccination rates remain too low, particularly in developing nations.
&gt; 
&gt; The Biden administration, meanwhile, is appealing a ruling by a Trump-appointed judge that struck down the federal transportation mask mandate, including on planes, though even if successful, the effort would face an American public that could be unwilling to comply again.
&gt; 
&gt; And in a reminder that the coronavirus is still present, the White House on Tuesday announced arguably the nation’s highest-profile coronavirus infection since President Donald Trump’s in 2020, saying that Vice President Harris had tested positive and was asymptomatic. She was not considered a close contact to Biden, the White House said.",502,0.99

The difference though is that people actually defended her lack of credentials and it worked to some extent. Where as candidates like her from before were brushed to the side. People don't remember but for about a week after Palin was announced as VP the McCain campaign went from being on life support to throwing some nasty hooks.

Laws are very broad and give sort of guiding principals and very minimal legal compliance.  Regulations tend to provide very specific things for an industry (copper pipes must be at least 1.191 feet off of the ground during installation).  And then you have ""best practices"" which are industry standards.

OHSA as an organization isn't just there to make sure a company is legally compliant but that they're doing their absolute best to protect the health and safety of their employees.  Most of the work OHSA does is paperwork and companies supply paperwork showing the things they're working on and things that they've improved.  OHSA reviews the work and either submits recommendations or just rubber stamps it.

And in person visit is rare from OHSA.  In 12 years I've met an OHSA officer just once.  When an OHSA officer says something it becomes a compliance mechanism that you have to institute.  It doesn't even have to be consistent company to company.  It's unlikely this Amazon warehouse was ever visited before this and so this investigations brings forth ""like 5 things"" that they'll have to comply with in the future.

Thing is, it was a tornado.  It's incredibly rare for tornados to hit buildings.  A tornado hit my city 60 years ago.... and I have no idea what our tornado procedures are... it's just not a concern.  Adding a lot of ""mostly useless"" training overwhelms workers with information and it's harder to retain.  Like in the case of the deaths, the six workers had the training to know where the designated shelter was and they decided to run into a bathroom to get shelter instead.

The Iranian regime considers science itself to be ""against Islam."" That's why there was a giant purge of academia after the Revolution, and why so much of the Persian diaspora is highly educated. 

All this despite the fact that academics were also anti-Shah, and supported the Revolution. 

&gt; In October 1979, just months after Iran redefined itself as an Islamic republic, revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini remarked on the large numbers of well-educated people who had left the country. “They say the brains escaped. Let them escape, **they are not educated people, and are treacherous brains,” Khomeini said. “It does not matter if they are university scholars**; they are the ones who are pro-Western civilization, let them go. We do not want their services and contributions.”

&gt; ... After the 1979 Iranian revolution, the country went through a period known as the Cultural Revolution, when regime policies aimed to eliminate non-Islamic and Western movements from universities, government offices, and other institutions. **Universities were officially closed for about three years as a government-designated council developed curricula that agreed with Islamic principles**, offering a prime period for academics to leave. According to data from the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education, there were 44 percent fewer professors in Iranian higher education institutions in 1982 than in 1980. 

&gt; .... Student protests during Mohammad Khatami’s presidency paved the way for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2006 to **launch a policy of ridding universities of “liberal and secular” academics** and influence, which he linked to colonialism. The posture pushed many university professors and faculty members into retirement, and may have had a significant role in spurring the emigration of scholars and professionals. Around this time, an estimated 150,000 to 180,000 educated Iranians were leaving Iran each year, according to media reports and analysts.

We've literally invaded countries and overthrown governments when we wanted something bad enough. They can 100% imprison most people if they *really* wanted to (not all at once though, obviously).

In my experience and opinion, the issue isn't that we don't have laws. The issue is those in charge of executing/enforcing them are bribed away from doing so, or otherwise influenced.",345,-0.914

In theory, you are right. 

In practice, North America is pretty much unassailable. More so in the west due to the Rockies. 

The Eastern side starts with an island, then the isthmus of Chignecto and then is either ridiculously built up that any invasion starts as urban warfare while still on the beach or is not a place to invade.

Now that isthmus is in Canada but do you really think Canada would win a war against the US in this situation?

The US would probably grab the big nearby stuff to CONUS early on like Canada and parts of Mexico to make Fortress North America.

And then it would be pretty much a draw as you said but not due to armies but due to logistics.

They don't have the sea lift capability to do something like Operation Torch anymore.

I can see them being able to grab Iceland, New Zealand and Australia easily. Northern South America to. But by pure population difference and the 3000+ km supply line, I can't see them capable of occupying enough of Africa or Europe to make a difference.

Nothing that he has said is really that far out of left field.

1. His own experience with Covid was mild at best, and he recovered quickly. This will definitely effect his opinion
2. It is commonly agreed upon that the aged group he is referring to is at much lower risk from Covid than the older age groups
3. Ivermectin was prescribed to him by his doctor, in conjunction with others meds, and they worked for him...so that will affect his opinion. (Ivermectin is a HUMAN anti parasitic, he took the HUMAN kind...not a horse one like CNN would suggest)
4. He regularly changes his views and opinion on topics, as seen when he fact checked HIMSELF live on air when he was wrong about ther Vaccine having a higher chance of heart inflammation than Covid...he didnt censor that, it is there for you to see that he was wrong.
5. He is a person, not a scientist, and he is only speaking his opinions. The amount of times he has had to say this is innumerable. He admits regularly that he doesnt know what he is talking about, and learns live with the people he speaks with.

To want to ""cancel"" a platform that consistently present you with interesting people and views, most that Rogan doesnt agree with, or understand, and he still has them on his show to discuss their topics...no censorship or media BS being done, all live, is seriously crazy...to think of what we would have left.
