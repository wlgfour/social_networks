It turns out that the wolves he initially thought were ""alpha"" were actually just the parents of the rest of the pack.

So, it's not real.

The only people I've ever come across who actually put merit to the idea of ""alpha males"" are the people who think of themselves as alphas, and tend to be just the ""loudest guy in the room"" types,  constantly bragging about themselves and trying to put others down, and the ones I've met have all been extremely misogynistic, all of which probably stems from insecurities.

Western media has gone as far as Villain(ess) Origin/Antihero (*Maleficent, Cruella, Wicked*), Transported to Another World (*Alice in Wonderland, Narnia, Wizard of Oz, Jumanji*), Reincarnation, and Time-Loop/Time-Travel (*Groundhog Day*) stories, but I don't think combining them is much of a thing beyond derivative work or pulp/Mills &amp; Boon-type fiction.

These themes are primarily based on revisiting a known narrative or setting, which means they rely on (and subvert) well-used tropes and tired formulas. This is only made possible through a culturally strong foundation in specific (sometimes kinda niche) genres.

Villainess as a theme heavily draws from a tradition of otome/joseimuke dating simulation games and 70's shoujo manga. The European-esque fantasy world styling is just ""foreign""-looking enough to be exotic for Asian readers, but still familiar and understandable, while giving the creator enough leeway to fudge details and historical accuracy. A lot of Korean webtoons have followed with that setting, I assume, because such themed assets are included in the illustration program.

Reincarnation/Transmigration are often plots for self-insert, fix-it fanfiction. The trope itself, from observation, only grew in the last 10-ish years. I believe that's why so many early works originated as web novels, before the genre grew big (and mutated differently) enough to be picked up for mainstream publishing and adaption.

Asia (starting with Japan) has a very robust industry to support the creation and feedback of indie/derivative work, which helps themes/tropes/plot devices/etc... gain traction and mature through repetition and refinement within the creator-consumer base.

In the West, some YA/fantasy authors started as fanfiction writers (on sites like Fanfiction.Net, LiveJournal, Tumblr, ArchiveOfOurOwn, Wattpad, etc...), so YA as a genre might yield something closer to what you're after, but otherwise indulgent, escapist fiction (aimed at young women) often seem to be considered too... I don't know, ""embarrassing"" to talk about, let alone admit to enjoying.

TL;DR: Cultural differences in attitudes towards certain genres, and support for derivative works, mean you probably won't find a 1:1 equivalent.",10

At a certain point in committed relationships, people might start wondering if they have experienced enough, or played the field, or are otherwise missing out. It's hard to say if they are, and it's a bit of a gamble whether they choose to stay or go; the most seemingly-stable things in your life might fall apart unexpectedly, just as the most promising prospects might not pan out well.

I think it's fairly normal to wonder about it, but pretty stupid to say it aloud to your partner, unless you've made your decision to leave already.

As you say, you will always feel you can do better, with that uncertainty nagging at you, which is why you should value and work on (improve?) your existing relationships (and whatever else) to ensure the unexpected does not creep up on you.

Sometimes we see people who we think are wasting their talents, and feel that it's a shame. We think they are capable of achieving more, something closer to *our* idea/s of ""success"", but it's not *their* idea of success. All the same, we end up feeling like we aren't getting to see them be the ""best"" version of themselves. Or we wish we could be a more inspiring/impactful presence in their lives. Could urging you to be more ambitious be her way of ensuring that you are, indeed, the right choice? The ""better"" option?

I don't know if she has particular insecurities about her career, compared to yours, and whether that drives her approach to work, money, or stability. Maybe she thinks it's not enough to just have ""enough"", and that you need more in reserve for emergencies. Or maybe she doesn't want to be just ""content"" when ""happiness"" seems to be in reach.

This could be a misalignment of values and expectations, and either one (or both) of you might consider adjusting. This is the time to see if valuing a relationship includes changing some things for one's partner. Maybe you'd be okay with more, maybe she'd be okay with less; there's no need to stay the same, always.",1

Your sister is just, for some reason, obsessed with the idea of you being gay. Maybe she's desperate for fabulous gay male company in her life, or she's closeted and projecting, who even knows. Whatever the reason, she has no business continually pushing her delusions on real-life people. It's disrespectful to you and your girlfriend, and your explicit wishes for her to stop that line of conversation. Not to mention it's just rude and nosy and obnoxious.

I'd email your concerns to the manager, with things the co-worker has said and asked you. Tell them you're going to try to sort this out with the co-worker personally first, but that you wanted to start a paper trail in case the co-worker tries to twist the narrative later. If the co-worker backs off, no harm done. If he doesn't, you'd have pre-empted some damage.

So... does that mean they're not gonna contact you to pay for their stuff now? I see that as an absolute win. Sometimes you just gotta make a stand, so they'll learn the lesson for themselves.

To me, that feels like a reflection of how much she values *you*, to so easily wh\*re you out to her friend and disrespect everything on your side of things.

This is an instance of something lacking in her fundamental values, that a nice calm talk alone won't fix. You put your foot down now, and you put it down **hard**.

1. Her homework is her responsibility; ""asking for help"" is not ""asking for someone else to do it for her"".
2. She has no right to barter anyone's time/attention/etc... except her own. Offering you up in exchange for something only she benefits from is a major overstep.
3. F\*cking rude. Seriously. To you and your girlfriend.
4. Your ""job"" as an older brother is to support and encourage her in her pursuits, to urge her to be the best she can be in any situation, to not abandon her even when she makes stupid decisions. *Not* to bail her out of her own (minor!) responsibilities.
5. Becky can't be all that smart if she thought your sister had a say in who you might sleep with. Otherwise Becky's trolling and enjoys seeing your sister squirm, or plans to hold this over her head. Either way, don't get Becky to do her homework.

*Constructive* criticism is pointing out where things could be done better, and how it can be improved. An overall remark like ""the performance was disappointing"" does nothing but undermine what good parts there were of it. Your MIL is not being ""supportive"" or ""constructive"" by belittling your daughter's efforts and undermining her self-esteem, and your husband needs to get his head outta his ass for enabling her. I'd bitchslap the woman if she comes anywhere near your daughter again, honestly.

People who justify their ""harsh truths"" with ""just telling it how it is"" etc... are more interested in being ""harsh"" than being ""truthful"".

**ETA:** Creative pursuits train the brain to think in different ways, and are otherwise invaluable tools to de-stress from high-pressure occupations (such as, *dundundun*, medicine!) Even if she doesn't use them later in life, she would be a much more flexible and adaptable for having various experiences to draw from. And success comes in many forms; she might well find something she enjoys and excels in that make her just as high-earning, successful, fulfilled, etc... as being a doctor. That your husband and MIL can't see such benefits or alternatives just goes to show how boorish and narrow-minded they are.",20

2 hour delays are almost par for course, and easily dealt with by sitting somewhere with a drink and scrolling your phone or checking out the shops. Or you could've easily checked flight status *before* you left the house.

While yes, being told of the delay during the layover would've been ideal, I would never count on someone to stay in reliable contact while they're travelling and/or in transit. Oftentimes they (airlines and passengers) don't even know how long a delay would be, as things are being dealt with. Sometimes delays happen *while* they're in the air, with no way to contact you.

You blamed your girlfriend for not communicating with you, then failed to communicate with her in turn. You drove 40 minutes home over a 2 hour (or 90 minute) wait on a day you had nothing else planned, and for what, really?",1

&gt; A Ukrainian soldier holed up in the Azovstal steel plant in Mariupol has pleaded for the West to rescue everyone trapped in the complex - as the allied forces did at Dunkirk in the famous Second World War operation.

&gt; Volyna said there are more than 600 injured Ukrainian soldiers and hundreds of civilians including children in the steel plant, the last Ukrainian pocket of resistance in the strategic port city.

&gt; The daring rescue mission saw Navy personnel and civilians travel from Britain in boats of all kinds to rescue the soldiers.

I have a fantasy that they have some secret way out, already covertly rescued the civilians and restocked the defenders a long time ago and have been posting the videos to bait the Russians into sticking around and tying up a bunch of BTGs that aren't being used in the Donbas.

In the early days of this war, people were laughing at the Russian casualties even though they ended up being able to claim a landmass the size of England.

Now that the tables have turned Ukraine has never managed to make a significant dent in the southern front lines. It is not easy at all. Despite all the US and EU supplies they receive, they have only managed to take a few rural areas. Some US deltas even tried night a drop into Azovstal but got shot down.

A parent was concerned that there is no secular alternative, and that the school is therefore discriminating against non-Christians and providing them a worse quality of education.

'Green Hydrogen', they call it, is hydrogen produced at green energy facilities like hydro dams or solar arrays. It can be transported anywhere, like fuel, and cars can be fueled up with it.

The main reason that it's handy is that it solves two problems that green grids can't solve alone. The first of these is that some industrial processes are badly suited to electrically generated heat, and need a combustion process such that green hydrogen is the only carbon neutral way to provide it. The second is military applications, where a moving front line could make it difficult to supply steady power generation to a vehicle depot, resulting in militaries preferring to use fueled vehicles when conducting operations over war-torn areas where existing infrastructure might stop working.

Since we're developing green hydrogen for these two applications already, the idea that people will use it for private vehicles too, and ultimately supplant regular electric vehicles, is not an unreasonable prediction.

In the interim, whether an EV will help the environment a lot will vary quite a bit from grid to grid. It's not something that can be treated as universal, and a lot of people arguing for only electric vehicles by 2050 may be wise to amend that to say 'only net zero emission vehicles by 2050' instead.",5

Being a billionaire is way too much power for one person to have, because they can basically decide on a whim to buy and change anything they want to for any kind of selfish reason, and it's okay to be a little weirded out by the idea that tomorrow, if Musk wanted to, he could replace the twitter bird with his portrait, or platform Andrew Yang (his favorite politician) with unique special features, or whatever.

But while it's disconcerting that one man can now despoil a community, he hasn't actually done anything yet. It's kind of a little too soon to jump to conclusions, and it might end up just being a feather in his proverbial cap. If he does ruin Twitter, people can always move to Reddit or make Discords or start posting short messages on Instagram. It'll suck to lose, but our worst case scenario is equivalent to Musk buying and shuttering Twitter.

It's still upsetting to live in a society where one person could, for example, buy and burn down Disneyland, or the New York Times. I think people feel a real sense of powerlessness over it, especially with how controversial Musk often is with that power. But there's room to be optimistic that nothing will actually happen. Often, billionaires buy these things on whims, and don't really change them. Until Musk pushes it, that's what I'm figuring happened here.

They did a bunch of tests into political discourse in the 90s, where they'd measure people's views on various issues, then pair people up with ideological opponents to chat for a while, then measure again.

They found that people always moved farther apart, rather than convincing one another. Two people with moderate views on the issue would emerge with more hardline beliefs. Someone who came in saying that they disagree with abortion because it promotes promiscuity would leave saying they disagree with abortion because it's murder. They'd shift from wanting fines to wanting jail time.

It's just how the human brain works. We don't make conclusions based on the evidence, we accrue evidence and arguments for our conclusions, and we literally forget anything that doesn't fit them, as a kind of political confirmation bias. In another study, they showed people the news, then quizzed them afterwards, and found that people were significantly more likely to remember events correctly if they confirmed an existing political bias (eg, budget hawks were very unlikely to remember that Bill Clinton balanced the budget, even twenty minutes after seeing it on the news).

Anyways, you should read about *Kelo vs New London* (as well as the history of Chavez Ravine). The city took Susette Kelo's house, and a bunch of other people's homes, to give a bunch of free land to Pfizer. 

The Supreme Court, namely Justices Stevens, Kennedy, Souter, Breyer and Ginsburg, said this was perfectly fine. That liberal wing of the court said that anything which generates higher public revenues can be claimed as a ""public use,"" even if those revenues come from a private business instead of more traditional public uses, like using seized property to build schools or roads. 

Then it turned out Pfizer didn't even want the land, and they never moved in. The land sat empty for years, basically becoming a landfill. 

[Nine Years after Kelo, the Seized Land Is Empty](https://www.nationalreview.com/2014/02/nine-years-after-kelo-seized-land-empty-alec-torres/)

The Iranian regime considers science itself to be ""against Islam."" That's why there was a giant purge of academia after the Revolution, and why so much of the Persian diaspora is highly educated. 

All this despite the fact that academics were also anti-Shah, and supported the Revolution. 

&gt; In October 1979, just months after Iran redefined itself as an Islamic republic, revolutionary leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini remarked on the large numbers of well-educated people who had left the country. “They say the brains escaped. Let them escape, **they are not educated people, and are treacherous brains,” Khomeini said. “It does not matter if they are university scholars**; they are the ones who are pro-Western civilization, let them go. We do not want their services and contributions.”

&gt; ... After the 1979 Iranian revolution, the country went through a period known as the Cultural Revolution, when regime policies aimed to eliminate non-Islamic and Western movements from universities, government offices, and other institutions. **Universities were officially closed for about three years as a government-designated council developed curricula that agreed with Islamic principles**, offering a prime period for academics to leave. According to data from the Ministry of Culture and Higher Education, there were 44 percent fewer professors in Iranian higher education institutions in 1982 than in 1980. 

&gt; .... Student protests during Mohammad Khatami’s presidency paved the way for President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in 2006 to **launch a policy of ridding universities of “liberal and secular” academics** and influence, which he linked to colonialism. The posture pushed many university professors and faculty members into retirement, and may have had a significant role in spurring the emigration of scholars and professionals. Around this time, an estimated 150,000 to 180,000 educated Iranians were leaving Iran each year, according to media reports and analysts.

If your parents aren’t okay with you getting a “real” job, look into babysitting or mowing lawns. Most people are very happy to give teenagers opportunities to work. 

If you have any experience working with kids, I would look into being a dance or gymnastics instructor.

So we were talking in the car and he called someone a douche in conversation and he goes ‘why do we even say douche? What is a douche anyway?’ And I launched into a pretty wordy explanation of how feminine odor was seen as a bad thing for decades and how squirting perfumed water up vaginas was common in the 1980s to ‘smell better down there’ but it’s really bad because vaginas are supposed to be naturally acidic to kill bacteria, but using douches messes with the natural pH and raises it to be more basic which causes yeast infections.

 [Soviet troops](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_during_the_occupation_of_Germany#Soviet_troops) 
 
 &gt;Sexual violence was committed by the armies of the Western Allies and the Red Army as their troops fought their way into the Third Reich and during the period of occupation. Mass rape by Soviet soldiers first began during the Battle of Romania and during the Budapest offensive in Hungary. On the territory of Nazi Germany, it began on 21 October 1944 when troops of the Red Army crossed the bridge over the Angerapp creek (marking the Germany–Poland border) and committed the Nemmersdorf massacre before they were beaten back a few hours later.

&gt; Register now for FREE unlimited access to Reuters.comApril 27 - Canadian lawmakers voted unanimously on Wednesday to call Russia&amp;#039;s attacks in Ukraine a &amp;quot;Genocide&amp;quot;, with members of parliament saying there was &amp;quot;Ample evidence of systemic and massive war crimes against humanity&amp;quot; being committed by Moscow.

&gt; Russia, which denies the genocide charges, calls its action in Ukraine a &amp;quot;Special military operation&amp;quot; and said it was necessary because the United States was using Ukraine to threaten Russia.

&gt; Moscow in turn accuses Ukraine of the genocide of Russian-speaking people, a charge that Ukraine dismisses as nonsense.

&amp;#x200B;

without even using the drake equation, you can look at all the things that have happened on earth, there have been other intelligent species that are now extinct that came from earths fairly mediocre properties, there are other earth like planets out there in the exact same conditions that earth is in, meaning life could birth from it.

instead of asking what makes us special? ask, what makes us mediocre? because the answer of what makes us special? is, if thats the case then everything is stacked against us which isn't the norm of the universe, the universe likes to balance itself out, meaning the universe likely didn't make us special and that we're somewhat normal.

&amp;#x200B;

edit: also, life on other planets isn't just other humanoid species or the stereotypical aliens we're all visioning, it's literally types of birds, insects, bacteria, mammals, fish, reptiles etc. etc. despite the fact they're just the wild life, they would still constitute as aliens.",39

So, it sucks for everyone, but I really can't blame her too much for trying to stay with someone who would be a decent father.

Yeah, they look more pronounced on darker people. [Personally, I like it when commericals have really dark people smiling with really white teeth.](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/82/b0/92/82b0922bcd0f87503828eaded95791de.jpg) It's just the contrast of it all.",2

I took Prim as a side character, damsel-in-distress saved by Katniss. Peeta, too, somewhat. I also dislike that Katniss ended up with Peeta but after all, they went through the same horrors side by side, and intentionally there wasn’t a lot of explanation to how their relationship developed from the performance for the games to something real.

I think the books would require a lot of changes in POV to accomplish what you were looking for. Yes these are valid criticisms, but Suzanne Collins had a certain vision and I think it was well-accomplished or else we wouldn’t experience such a cultural impact from the franchise. I love how she gave certain side characters (not all, but some) a narrative and interesting motivations, most notably Finnick which is probably why he’s your favorite.

Though I don’t entirely agree with you, I love the analysis and thought you put into this popular favorite! Never stop thinking critically about your favorite books or what you’d like to see done differently!",7

I guess my point is that what we call “sound” (like color) is related to physical properties or circumstances but isn’t identical with those properties or circumstances. It’s an experience - one entirely dependent on how our neurology interprets things. “Redness” is how our neurology interprets a specific wavelength of light. “Sound” is how our neurology interprets moving molecules of air. Wittgenstein said “If lions could talk, we wouldn’t understand them.” This is what he meant. Their neurology is different, so what they experience is different. 

Look up Mantis Shrimp. The world they experience is radically different from ours - and NOT because the physical world is any different for them.",2
