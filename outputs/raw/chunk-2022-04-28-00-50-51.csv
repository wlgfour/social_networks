But first let's stipulate that gibberish pages that merely exist to list every ""keyword"" to act as spam bait don't count as legitimate results.

Sure, man I'd be glad to

lets search for ""caligae"" (a type of ancient Roman sandal) and ""tannin"" (a material used to preserve leather)

Neither is a common word, so it should not be eliminated for that reason.

https://www.google.com/search?q=caligae+tannin&amp;oq=caligae+tannin
Google says there are 106,000 hits. That is a uselessly large number of results. Yet the very first hit is ""missing"" the word tannin, literally half the search terms are rejected.
Hit number 5 says it's missing the word tannin. Hit number 4 is ALSO missing tannin (although google doesn't admit it). Hits 7, 8, and 9 are missing caligae because the keyword stemming has associated caligae and caliga...which might be acceptable except that caliga is ALSO a proper noun!

Now let's look at the search results with verbatim mode engaged:
https://www.google.com/search?q=%22caligae%22+%22tannin%22

We STILL HAVE 23,900 hits. Still too many to search through manually, but NOT ZERO.

Rare search terms were ignored to turn 23,900 hits into 106,000 hits. I have conclusively proven that you are wrong about *when* google ignores search terms, and therefore you are objectively wrong about *why* they ignore search terms.",1

They would protest, and there would always be a counter protest, and people would just bully the shit out of them the entire time Westboro was protesting.

Eventually my number stopped being answered by any office. It's a point of personal pride. More people should prank call Scientology.

Weird story but a girl I dated in my mid 20s was in college and had to write an essay, I was still strongly in the ""fuck Scientology"" mindset (admittedly influenced by South Park lol) so I steered her into writing about them. She checked out a book about Scientology from the local library to use as a source, and within a couple days she recieved an email from Scientology offering more information and asking her to join. No idea how they got her personal email address (I believe she told me she didn't provide her email to the library, but even if she did that's really strange and invasive). I probably wouldn't have believed it if I didn't see the email with my own eyes.

In fact, I would argue that the main goal has always and will always be diminishing China from dislodging Western hegemony that has governed the world for over a century. China has had a hard-on for doing this for quite a while, and nothing good would come of such a thing internationally.

To be honest, if that's not the ultimate goal of the West then I'd say our leaders are fucking insane because WWIII is coming down the pike eventually and one of the main aggressors *will* be China. They just want Russia undiminished when it's time to start the war; Russia being sanctioned into a blackhole that will take decades to get out of economically *and* militarily was not in the game-plan, at least for China.

China's bullshit rhetoric that they are not imperialist themselves and are agents of peace is the equivalent of Putin saying they are going to open up humanitarian corridors in besieged cities: it's not worth the buffalo shit on a nickel when they have the overwhelming advantage. Once China has the overwhelming advantage they'll absolutely take advantage of starting a land war for resources. 

Russia is somewhat easy to deal with, by and large, in comparison; China is on a whole different playing field, though.

Interestingly, 2014's annexation of Crimea is when Putin and Xi's friendship really took off and they started doing military exercises together. Hmm... I wonder why?

Follow the breadcrumbs and you'll see that a lot of this clusterfuck of a situation started not just with Russia but also China as well---which is why China will never, ever give up on Russia. Russia is the international 'bad guy' that China can use to intimidate/undermine the West, much like Kim Jong-un and his sabre rattling bullshit while looking innocent on the international stage. Putin is far more valuable to Xi alive than dead, always has been, so Xi will do everything he can to ensure that Putin himself keeps control of Russia (or at least has a worthy successor that Xi approves of lined up) for the possible WWIII that will eventually happen.

China refusing to formally disavow Russia ripped the mask off of China and their so called 'peaceful neutrality', which I think was sorta the point that the West wanted to prove. So, there's that.",1

What would normally happen is that diplomatic back-channels would discuss to understand each other's intentions and avoid all out war if there's no sign that Russia intends to go further... So the question would be: What is NATO's conventional response?

Here's the problem scenario: If back-channels go silent, then the U.S. and its allies will not wait to see what happens next, and will launch a massive counterstrike... but it would have to catch Russia off guard.

One thing that hasn't been discussed in all of this is that while the U.S. has been providing Ukraine intel on Russian troop and equipment movements, it obviously has been assessing the speed of their logistical response... but also assessing from where these movements are coming.

The other thing we know is that Putin is heavily isolated, his commanders do not tell him about losses for fear of reprisals, and they use conventional unencrypted comms.  All of these factors work against them.

There is one particular class of technology in the U.S. arsenal that only one other country, an ally, has ever used in combat... Stealth.  A series of high value targets could be chosen on the basis of where these troop and equipment movements lead back to.  Or, we could just do a massive show of force... over the Black Sea... turn on the transponders for a blip, scare the shit out of every Russian naval and air defense commander, and fly back to NATO territory and wait for the phone to ring.",47

1 generation, no other country had the weird obsession, they just call themselves British, Scottish, Welsh, Irish, French, German, Italian, Spanish if they were born there and lived there they never say oh I'm x-british, x-irish or x-french.

There's no grey area, you can't claim a heritage just because some distant relatives lived there centuries before you were born in another country, otherwise we'd all be African.

If the person in Norway was born in the US to American parents they'd be American. If their kids were born and grew up their they'd be Norwegian.

The US is not inclusive, no inclusive country start by introducing themselves as X-followed by Nationality it's absurd. And rightly every other nation mocks you for it.

The *good* news is that Russia has totally fucked itself for at least 50 years. They'll never be able to mount another invasion like this again in my lifetime. Remember, it's been over 30 years since the failed Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, and Russia hasn't been in a near-peer conflict since.",3

You weigh less than I do at a similar height, and I'm in the bottom 1/3 of the healthy BMI for my height.

At your age, if you just focus on eating healthy whole foods until you aren't hungry anymore, you should do OK. I think you might be falling victim to the fallacy of ""a calorie is a calorie,"" an idea that seems to be rearing its ugly head again recently.

While CICO works, not all calories are equal. Focus on protein, whole grains, whole vegetables, whole fruits, full fat dairy (if you can eat it), healthy nuts (without too much salt), legumes, etc.

What you eat *is* just as important as how much you eat simply because eating whole foods is more satiating than eating calorie dense or processed foods. American cheese on white bread is simply not as healthy in any way as eating fruit, unsweetened yogurt, and muesli (or some other grain of your choice).",0

Even once a week is manageable. Think about this. If you ate double calories a single day per week, but ate at deficit the rest of the week, that one day is diluted by 6 days of progress. I guess it depends on how much you're overeating vs how much your daily deficit is.

Single days do not break a meal plan - continuous poor choices do.

For social situations, I just find *one* item I like and have *one* portion of it. I put the plate down and move on to socializing. If you're drinking alcohol or sugary drinks at these events, switch to water. You can't want to lose weight and also want to drink 4 beers at every social event - the two are wholly incompatible.",5
