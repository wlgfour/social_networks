If you used Illustrator and a laser (they're quite affordable especially for paper) you'd have a scalable library of stuff like this which could become useful someday for things like murals or larger pieces. You would also be able to mix and match elements. It takes the same skill to design and meticulously build digital paths. Being able to sell a variety of sizes once you've done the lion's share of the work once is how you can pay yourself well for your time. When people say ""starving artists"" it's often because they feel it's important to make unique pieces by hand. I did a design degree instead of a BFA for this reason. Can't beat em, join em'."

Sometimes it was even rubbing its body up against me.  If you're not familiar with them, they're kind of like giant piranhas, they're ferocious predators with similar really sharp teeth.  They're *usually* not dangerous to humans because we're too big to be prey, but it's not unheard of for them to bite divers, so I was kind of freaking out because even though it wasn't being aggressive, it also would not leave me alone.

After my dive I talked to some of the locals and they knew exactly which fish I was talking about.  They said that this particular barracuda was actually raised in the nearby Coral World Ocean Park and they had released it when it got too large.  So it had been around humans all its life and it just loved people, it was notorious for hanging out with scuba divers because it remembered swimming with its handlers in the park.  It was actually really sweet and kind of sad.  They had released it, but it wouldn't leave the area, it just hung around Coki Beach and was kind of a mascot."

I've got a couple. One is mine, one is a friend's.

So my friend was checking a lead in an offset sink to see if there was any going cave one afternoon. Offset sinks are physically distant from the main cave conduit, so while a primary trunk passage may have lots of clear ground water, an offset sink won't get much water circulation, so rainwater and runoff will tend to stay there for a long time. They're typically very murky and brown, clearing as you approach main cave passage. He's about 100ft in at a depth of 40 or 50ft. Nothing insane, but it's braille diving. Trying to feel his way around while running a line to see if anything goes. He comes across a wall about a foot in front of him that looks a bit unique. Often times you'll see cool patterns of mineral buildup in cave walls/floors/ceilings. So he's appreciating this cool pattern when that pattern opens its mouth and shows off its teeth and tongue. Turns out a not insignificantly sized gator lived in that sink and wasn't happy about the home invasion. He set a new speed record getting back to the surface of that particular sink. Gators aren't uncommon down there and they usually leave you alone, but not when you get that close to them in their own territory.

My story was a bit less exciting but pretty somber. I was doing a dive in the back of a fairly regularly traveled cave system, but in an area where a body had been recovered from about a mile back the week prior. That area isn't as regularly dived due to the logistics and cave passage geometry. It's not a small dive to get back there. The recovery was really challenging and there were signs of damage to the cave as we swam along where the body had been forced through restrictions, through mud, etc. But the real reality check came when we found his mask in the mud several thousand feet back. It had been dislodged (along with his nose) while the recovery divers tried to force him through a small area. It really drove home the reality of where I was and what I was doing and the respect necessary for the environment."

Very dark though which had me on edge. Not a very well preserved wreck but it was awesome to see everything down there. 

There was a huge expanse of open water to the side of the wreck that kind of began to slope off, and as we left the wreck we saw a huge tiger shark floating in that open water. My friends and I just swam back to our ship slowly and it didn’t really follow, but if you know anything about tiger sharks, you know how aggressive they can be, and how menacing one would look in dark water.

Seeing something like that, in that environment, with that level of darkness (it was the evening) is terrifying. The fact that it could hurt you if it wanted and you can’t do anything about it makes it 10x worse. All you can really do is keep calm and keep your distance. Remembering this around large dangerous aquatic creatures has always worked for me and I’ve never been harmed. In hindsight, it was a very beautiful moment but I def didn’t think that at the time."

So this is proper babby's first free dive material and I've since learned I'm terrified of the ocean, so this probably isn't that scary to most people. However...

I was on a boat tour that stopped off in a small bay with fucking beautiful, crystal clear, light turquoise water and nearly white sands. We'd just finished swimming with some sting rays when the tour guide offered to take some of us out for a swim in deeper water.

I was hesitant as he said the current can get quite strong and I'm not the best swimmer, but he said I could join them for as long as I felt comfortable, so I came along.

There was a small group going at a leisurely pace that I could clearly see, so I decided to do some free diving. As I said, the water was gorgeously clear. I was diving down to these little reef outcrops and checking out the fish and had barely looked ahead of me other than to check on the group.

I finished inspecting another little coral group and turned around to see where the group were and suddenly saw the sandy sea floor disappear over a knife sharp drop off. The water was so deep and inky blue with no sea floor in sight and my stomach somehow dropped into my ass and jumped into my throat at the same time.

I surfaced ASAP and got as far away from the drop off as possible and tried to pretend I never saw it."

I grew up right by Lake Superior in Michigan and was lucky enough to have an old 17’ boat with a blown head gasket. Two experiences come to mind that really freaked me out. I was out on another friends boat and we were “free diving” as we called it. Our process was to grab a couple big rocks, 50 lbs or bigger, load them up on a pontoon boat then head offshore to a drop off where the depth went down to 100’. We’d put on a life jacket, grab a big rock, and jump off then hold on as long as we could while the others on the boat watched the fish finder to see how deep we could get before letting go of the rock. It usually wasn’t even the breath holding that would get you to let go it was the frigid temperature. The driver would back up the boat after the diver jumped off so they wouldn’t rocket back up into a pontoon, the whole thing was pretty well thought out and we enjoyed it. Anyway, I once accidentally hit the clasp on the life jacket with the rock leading to the life jacket popping off while I was 80’ underwater. I was able to swim back up but I wasn’t that buoyant and that was a long long swim especially when muscles are already shocked from the cold. I ended up having to get dragged back on the boat by my buddies once I surfaced and was laying on the floor of the boat for a solid ten minutes recovering after the ordeal. That was surreal as hell and for a few seconds underwater I was thinking I might actually die, not fun.

The second incident was on my own boat, alone, again being dumb. I was fishing maybe a mile offshore, and the weather was fine most of the day. Then in the course of a few minutes a wind whipped up. It wasn’t anything major, I’d been out in much heavier weather and wasn’t overly concerned, but decided to go in. To get back in I had to go through a set of breakers, big rock walls with a gap between them that prevented waves blasting into a canal. This particular day the speed and the direction of the wind kicked up some waves that were just the right height and distance apart that I couldn’t handle them. The waves weren’t big but I was having an issue with something called broaching. I couldn’t surf the waves quite right because they were steep enough that with less power I wouldn’t have good control and with more power I’d go over the wave, hit the trough of the wave in front, and the whole boat would try to kick itself sideways and would likely capsize. I was able to keep alternating power and trimmed way the hell up so my bow wouldn’t handle them as poorly, but it was still a struggle getting in and I was seriously thinking I was gonna end up capsizing the entire time. I only had to crest maybe five or six waves to actually get through the breakers but each one I was nervous as hell for. I made it but that was the last time I ever took that boat past the breakers. 

I guess these aren’t like, creepy as in paranormal or anything like that, but they definitely freaked me the hell out….Fun times, psa parents, don’t give your kids boats/let them pull them out of other peoples yards and jerry rig them to run with spare parts from a ford tempo and gasket sealant, bad plan."

When I was just shy of 15, we moved to Ventura, California. I met a classic ""surfer girl"". Everything a 15 yo could want, she was 16, had a car, her mother's VW bug, and she thought the fact that I could ride horses, was a tiny bit American Indian, and grew up on a ranch was the coolest thing ever.

So, I learned to surf, of course. Loved it. Made friends with some of the other surfers. Everyone called me Jethro, or Cowboy. So, we're all sitting in about thirty feet of water and Mako darts under us. My tanned hide turned white as a sheet. All the kids were a little nervous, honestly.

It made a couple of circles and moved away. We all just went back to surfing. When we moved back to Oklahoma, I was telling a friend and my mother flipped the hell out like I'd almost been kidnapped by a creep from a PSA.

""OH MY GOD! Why didn't you tell me?""

Really, mom? That's the story that makes you shake and shudder? Wow. I dodged feral hogs, thrown from horses, charged by bulls and mama cows, and rode around in the beds of picks ups with my grandfather bucking hay. My mother was a single mom and we lived in a terrible neighborhood in a small blue collar town until I was 13. Gangs, drugs, child rapists. But, that was the one that turned her full Karen. LMAO."

One of the better assignments I was put on was identifying whale sharks in the Ningaloo Reef area, not far off of the coast of Western Australia. My job was to swim next to the shark as it cruised past and take pictures, which would then be used to identify and create a record of the shark. It was really interesting how they did it, I was told they used the same program that NASA used to map the stars to ID the sharks based on their unique spot patterns. 

Whale sharks are harmless to people, and generally pretty indifferent to divers, but they're the kind of massive that's hard to appreciate until you see one up close. I think it was on my second or third dive that we were told of a particularly big shark by the spotters (about 9-10 metres, they get a lot bigger but the ones in this area are nearly all juvenile males). We jumped in and waited for it to cruise past, but this one took an unexpected turn and was swimming very quickly towards us. I kicked like crazy and managed to get out of its way, but it missed me by barely a foot. 

I was never in any real danger, worst case it would have just bumped me out of the way, but seeing a fish with a head the size of an SUV hurtling toward you underwater is something else."

This fin was more triangular with a serrated back side (almost like a steak knife) with a sandpaper looking texture. Dolphins have more scoop in their fin and very smooth texture on their skin.

The way it swam gave me instant chills- fishy, more side to side and straight than the classic up and down, coming up for breath dolphin. 

I froze. Trying to control my panic, waited for it to disappear and as smoothly as possible, turned my board around, paddled through the pier back to land.

I had recently moved there so it was all new to me, but I had seen them in the water with me previously. The break was pretty far out so I’m just floating peacefully alone waiting for a set of waves. I saw a large set of swells coming so I got down on my board and started paddling. Just as I’m about to pop up onto the board I take a final quick glance back to make sure all is good and a huge creature explodes out of the face of the wave right next to me. I panic and bail, scared shitless, and if felt like I did a cartoon run on top of the water how fast I got all the way in to shore. On the beach it there are people watching and talking about it as it was still out there playing in the waves. It looked like a huge dolphin but people thought it might be a pilot whale."

Around where I grew up there was an assortment of U shaped little cove things. A whole series of them UUUU that were surrounded by very tall cliffs. The only way out when the tide came in and cut you off was to sprint for it and hope you get to a U that has an exit (most dont) or just kinda wait until low tide, and hope high tide isn't that high. The cliffs mean you can't phone for help either so beyond yelling you see fucked. 

Swimming for it is a great way to get dashed against the rocks or drowned. For me once it gets to about upper thigh level you are really taking your life into your own hands wading back. 

It almost got me as a teen on many occasions. On one occasion I had to climb up the cliffs. Thank God I had rock climbing experiance. One time I did swim for it and very nearly drowned. 

Folks get caught out all the time by it. They just take the dog for a nice little walk along the beach and suddenly find themselves cut off by very strong tides pinned between that and a giant cliff. Low tide is perfectly safe. Incoming high tide is absolurely not. 

I was in one of the cave systems (not that deep really no torch needed for example) and lost track of time. By the time I got back to the entrance the waves had eroded a lot of the sand. It went from a sand walkway up to the cave to the end of the cave spitting out to a drop where I couldn't feel the bottom. Rapidly deteriorating. Cut my hands up on the rocks bouldering to the side to get around to where it was safe again. The place is a bloody death trap. 

Actually inside the water? 

On holiday I once trod on a very large stingray. Maybe 40cm across? Luckily I trod on part of it that wasn't the stinger and didn't step down hard - it simply felt my foot and split. I had no idea it was even there until i saw and felt it moving. 

When I was maybe 14, I was at the beach and ran down into the water while my mam was messing around doing something. I am standing out there chest high in the water waving and my mam just starts screaming. I didn't even notice at the time but I was basically standing in the middle of a jellyfish swarm. I know they weren't there when I got into the water. I am not *that* oblivious. The jellyfish were not harmful a bit of vinegar (I think) and the sting doesn't even hurt anymore. My mother didn't know that. I didn't get stung but she did when she charged into the water to drag me out while I was just calmly and slowly exiting. Apparently calm movements were not appropriate for the situation in her eyes. 

I did a tour of the local lifeguard place once and those folks have one hell of a dark humor. What stuck with me though; the main boat they use has a small sealed cabin. Apparently they could fit like 30 people on as rescues Inc staff. 6 of us were on (Inc staff) and it was uncomfortably snug. They then go on to say that the control cabin is sealed but most rescues would be on the deck part. If conditions caused a flip the crew would be safe, right the boat, and then buzz around picking eveyone back out of the water. To me this both makes absolute sense and also is very distressing. Imagine nearly drowning and then being punted back into the ocean along with God knows how many people. Horrifying. 

Octopus are also super smart. I saw one on a dive once, a daytime dive, just mooching around. As we approached it took off (no ink tho) towards this random rock maybe 5m away. We followed at a distance and I saw it dive into a hole in that rock and then *pick up a rock from inside the hole and use it to plug the hole from the inside*. Just **slam** no soliciting. 

Let me tell you that hysterical laughter with a regulator isn't ideal. Only one other person on the dive saw it and was also in fits. Nobody knew why both of us had suddenly gotten ourselves into apparent distress at the exact same time. You won't drown or anything but it can be a little uncomfortable and other folks will think you are in trouble esp if your mask starts to fill up as mine did. We had to end the dive a bit early because the hysterical laughter used up more oxygen than was expected. We gave a bunch of ok's but you could tell eveyone else was on edge and keeping a close eye. My mam was with me on that dive and wouldn't ever get more than about 2ft from me after it. Presumably worried I will drown. She still complains about it *'I thought you were having a seizure'*. 

The good side of the octopus incident is that folks knew exactly what to do and eveyone sprung into action. I was offered several spare regs pretty much the moment folks noticed my breathing and body position was incorrect the dive group split into 2 to deal with each of us seperatly. Someone got right up in my face and looked me in the eyes and checked all my kit to try and figure out the issue and folks prepared the inital steps to quit the dive. I gave the OK multiple times but nobody fully belived me which I kinda get. I had to bat my mam away from my float vest because she was ready to make me go up regardless of my opinion of the matter (I am an adult and was at the time but some habits I guess admittedly I would have done exactly the same to her if I thought she was going to drown). It wasn't scary for me but it was for her. She was of the opinion she was watching her eldest child about to die. For the entire rest of the dive if I so much as paused she was all over me like a rash!"

I was nervous initially when visited my first wreck as I thought I would find them foreboding and spooky (like if you stand next to a big truck or a train that’s parked!) but as soon as the wreck loomed out of the blue I was excited to go inside. 

My spookiest experience was diving a wreck off Gozo, Malta. I was down in the engine room of a 58m-long passenger ship, c40m deep at that point in the dive. It was dark, we were early in the day but some silt disturbed and vis was poor in the room. The ship is at a slight list, and as we circled the engine room and went to go back up my brain scrambled at the slightly off-level angle of the stairs as they came into view. 

I felt a pang of pure confusion and realised it was potentially the effects of disorientation mixed with gas-narcosis (40m here). 

I had to say to myself ‘hey, you know what this is, it’s fine’ followed my Buddy to the deck above and felt fine after that. 

I’m fortunate to be diving with a very experienced buddy (DM) and guide and have visited that particular wreck a number of times. It was the first time I had recognised feeling narc’ed and made me a better diver for the experience- the moment of pure brain fog was a reminder that shit can get serious very quickly at any depth. I can imagine that my short moment of disorientation mixed with challenging conditions or gear malfunction would have been a problem. 

If you want to see the stairs and wreck there’s loads of  pics online- search ‘MV Karwela’ and you’ll see!"

I'm going out on the great barrier reef tomorrow and I'm hoping one of the dives will be a SCUBA drift dive. Basically you get dropped usually directly in deep water and the current pulls you along the ocean wall you're diving against to where the boat picks you up again.

However, sometimes on drift dives, you start just in a shallow coral outcrop. You drop in where it's maybe 10m deep, then you swim towards the outer edge of the reef and....nothing. There is a literal cliff that drops off from 10m down to about 1000ft or more that fades from light blue to inky black as you look down. Because the bottom continues out due to the reef several miles out from the shore, there's no continental shelf gradual drop off. When the reef ends, there's nothing but a cliff 1000ft or more deep. You drift along this cliff and stay above 30m to see the corals, plants and wildlife that live along the edge. Because of the current, nutrients are floating by everyday constantly refreshed, so the wildlife is abundant.

When you come from the shallows and reach the cliff it is exhilarating. I don't find it terrifying, because I feel at home in the water and the ocean doesn't scare me (some of the things in it do...). I get this enormous sense of...emptiness. But not fear. If anything, loneliness. Because when you're looking out from that shelf, the next thing you would reach if you swam directly out is Peru or Chile nearly 11000 miles away...."

He had this cool diving watch, which gave you active depth readings, so while swimming i'd go subsurface and touch the ocean floor, check the depth and come back up. 10feet....20feet and then we reached this little bump, in the middle of the sea and the water was at knee level - so we had to walk across it. After walking for maybe 20 metres - it just disappeared, and there was a bottomless drop, i couldn't see the ocean floor. It was spooky but freeing of sorts, i love the ocean. We continued swimming for maybe an hour more and came back to the shore. One of my favourite memories"

Sometimes it was even rubbing its body up against me.  If you're not familiar with them, they're kind of like giant piranhas, they're ferocious predators with similar really sharp teeth.  They're *usually* not dangerous to humans because we're too big to be prey, but it's not unheard of for them to bite divers, so I was kind of freaking out because even though it wasn't being aggressive, it also would not leave me alone.

After my dive I talked to some of the locals and they knew exactly which fish I was talking about.  They said that this particular barracuda was actually raised in the nearby Coral World Ocean Park and they had released it when it got too large.  So it had been around humans all its life and it just loved people, it was notorious for hanging out with scuba divers because it remembered swimming with its handlers in the park.  It was actually really sweet and kind of sad.  They had released it, but it wouldn't leave the area, it just hung around Coki Beach and was kind of a mascot."

I've got a couple. One is mine, one is a friend's.

So my friend was checking a lead in an offset sink to see if there was any going cave one afternoon. Offset sinks are physically distant from the main cave conduit, so while a primary trunk passage may have lots of clear ground water, an offset sink won't get much water circulation, so rainwater and runoff will tend to stay there for a long time. They're typically very murky and brown, clearing as you approach main cave passage. He's about 100ft in at a depth of 40 or 50ft. Nothing insane, but it's braille diving. Trying to feel his way around while running a line to see if anything goes. He comes across a wall about a foot in front of him that looks a bit unique. Often times you'll see cool patterns of mineral buildup in cave walls/floors/ceilings. So he's appreciating this cool pattern when that pattern opens its mouth and shows off its teeth and tongue. Turns out a not insignificantly sized gator lived in that sink and wasn't happy about the home invasion. He set a new speed record getting back to the surface of that particular sink. Gators aren't uncommon down there and they usually leave you alone, but not when you get that close to them in their own territory.

My story was a bit less exciting but pretty somber. I was doing a dive in the back of a fairly regularly traveled cave system, but in an area where a body had been recovered from about a mile back the week prior. That area isn't as regularly dived due to the logistics and cave passage geometry. It's not a small dive to get back there. The recovery was really challenging and there were signs of damage to the cave as we swam along where the body had been forced through restrictions, through mud, etc. But the real reality check came when we found his mask in the mud several thousand feet back. It had been dislodged (along with his nose) while the recovery divers tried to force him through a small area. It really drove home the reality of where I was and what I was doing and the respect necessary for the environment."

Seeing something like that, in that environment, with that level of darkness (it was the evening) is terrifying. The fact that it could hurt you if it wanted and you can’t do anything about it makes it 10x worse. All you can really do is keep calm and keep your distance.

So this is proper babby's first free dive material and I've since learned I'm terrified of the ocean, so this probably isn't that scary to most people. However...

I was on a boat tour that stopped off in a small bay with fucking beautiful, crystal clear, light turquoise water and nearly white sands. We'd just finished swimming with some sting rays when the tour guide offered to take some of us out for a swim in deeper water.

I was hesitant as he said the current can get quite strong and I'm not the best swimmer, but he said I could join them for as long as I felt comfortable, so I came along.

There was a small group going at a leisurely pace that I could clearly see, so I decided to do some free diving. As I said, the water was gorgeously clear. I was diving down to these little reef outcrops and checking out the fish and had barely looked ahead of me other than to check on the group.

I finished inspecting another little coral group and turned around to see where the group were and suddenly saw the sandy sea floor disappear over a knife sharp drop off. The water was so deep and inky blue with no sea floor in sight and my stomach somehow dropped into my ass and jumped into my throat at the same time.

I surfaced ASAP and got as far away from the drop off as possible and tried to pretend I never saw it."

I grew up right by Lake Superior in Michigan and was lucky enough to have an old 17’ boat with a blown head gasket. Two experiences come to mind that really freaked me out. I was out on another friends boat and we were “free diving” as we called it. Our process was to grab a couple big rocks, 50 lbs or bigger, load them up on a pontoon boat then head offshore to a drop off where the depth went down to 100’. We’d put on a life jacket, grab a big rock, and jump off then hold on as long as we could while the others on the boat watched the fish finder to see how deep we could get before letting go of the rock. It usually wasn’t even the breath holding that would get you to let go it was the frigid temperature. The driver would back up the boat after the diver jumped off so they wouldn’t rocket back up into a pontoon, the whole thing was pretty well thought out and we enjoyed it. Anyway, I once accidentally hit the clasp on the life jacket with the rock leading to the life jacket popping off while I was 80’ underwater. I was able to swim back up but I wasn’t that buoyant and that was a long long swim especially when muscles are already shocked from the cold. I ended up having to get dragged back on the boat by my buddies once I surfaced and was laying on the floor of the boat for a solid ten minutes recovering after the ordeal. That was surreal as hell and for a few seconds underwater I was thinking I might actually die, not fun.

The second incident was on my own boat, alone, again being dumb. I was fishing maybe a mile offshore, and the weather was fine most of the day. Then in the course of a few minutes a wind whipped up. It wasn’t anything major, I’d been out in much heavier weather and wasn’t overly concerned, but decided to go in. To get back in I had to go through a set of breakers, big rock walls with a gap between them that prevented waves blasting into a canal. This particular day the speed and the direction of the wind kicked up some waves that were just the right height and distance apart that I couldn’t handle them. The waves weren’t big but I was having an issue with something called broaching. I couldn’t surf the waves quite right because they were steep enough that with less power I wouldn’t have good control and with more power I’d go over the wave, hit the trough of the wave in front, and the whole boat would try to kick itself sideways and would likely capsize. I was able to keep alternating power and trimmed way the hell up so my bow wouldn’t handle them as poorly, but it was still a struggle getting in and I was seriously thinking I was gonna end up capsizing the entire time. I only had to crest maybe five or six waves to actually get through the breakers but each one I was nervous as hell for. I made it but that was the last time I ever took that boat past the breakers. 

I guess these aren’t like, creepy as in paranormal or anything like that, but they definitely freaked me the hell out….Fun times, psa parents, don’t give your kids boats/let them pull them out of other peoples yards and jerry rig them to run with spare parts from a ford tempo and gasket sealant, bad plan."

It was really interesting how they did it, I was told they used the same program that NASA used to map the stars to ID the sharks based on their unique spot patterns. 

Whale sharks are harmless to people, and generally pretty indifferent to divers, but they're the kind of massive that's hard to appreciate until you see one up close. I think it was on my second or third dive that we were told of a particularly big shark by the spotters (about 9-10 metres, they get a lot bigger but the ones in this area are nearly all juvenile males). We jumped in and waited for it to cruise past, but this one took an unexpected turn and was swimming very quickly towards us.

Scuba diving just off the coast of Cambodia was also rather creepy in some spots: instructors told us the navy had tested ordnance in the area, like a barren desert within the sea, all the reef had been blasted into sand.

It was flat, onshore wind, really messy conditions but I spent 40 min driving there and said “ I’ll just get in the water and paddle around a bit”. There was nobody in the water.

I decided to paddle around the pier, going from the north side to the south side. When I reached the last pylon, a HUGE fin popped up about 5 feet in front of me. I knew instantly it was a massive white shark (12-15ft based on the size of the fin)- I’ve been surfing my whole life, I’ve been in the water with dolphins many times. This was 100% not a dolphin.

This fin was more triangular with a serrated back side (almost like a steak knife) with a sandpaper looking texture. Dolphins have more scoop in their fin and very smooth texture on their skin.

The way it swam gave me instant chills- fishy, more side to side and straight than the classic up and down, coming up for breath dolphin. 

I froze. Trying to control my panic, waited for it to disappear and as smoothly as possible, turned my board around, paddled through the pier back to land.

It was absolutely checking me out but didn’t show any interest towards me. Since then, I’m not that afraid of sharks but I still get the chills thinking about that day."

I was 14 at the time and my parents were life long divers, we dived the Coolidge twice that day already and our guide offered a night dive to us. 
We were supposed to only dive down to a depth of 25 meters and check out these flashlight fish that would school together in a cargo hold, they had these really bright green eyes that looked amazing and lit up underwater. I still don’t really know what happened that night but it felt like we were staring at these fish for forever. Suddenly I didn’t feel right, my breathing felt funny, I tried to grab my gauge to check how much air I had left, it took every bit of muscle I had to reach for my gauge connected to my waist, I slowly grabbed it and read that I had about half a tank left, relived for a split second but still concerned something was wrong I reached for my mum to signal her something wasn’t right, I grabbed her arm but couldn’t hold on, I just started sinking to the bottom. My mum quickly grabbed my arm as I fell but I had no leg movement, so I started dragging her to the bottom with me, my dad now realises somethings wrong and grabs my mum trying to pull us all up. The dive guide now is freaking out and trying to make sure everyone is alright, they all start swimming me back up and in to shore. Once we got up closer, I started to feel normal again but abit dazed and confused. Turns out I had nitrogen narcosis, and had dropped to 40 meters when I couldn’t swim anymore. For those of you who don’t know what nitrogen narcosis is, it’s when you have to much nitrogen in your body and it gives you a intoxicated effect. 
Nothing to hectic but still a vivid memory of thinking I was gonna sink to the bottom of the ocean not being able to do anything about it."

Around where I grew up there was an assortment of U shaped little cove things. A whole series of them UUUU that were surrounded by very tall cliffs. The only way out when the tide came in and cut you off was to sprint for it and hope you get to a U that has an exit (most dont) or just kinda wait until low tide, and hope high tide isn't that high. The cliffs mean you can't phone for help either so beyond yelling you see fucked. 

Swimming for it is a great way to get dashed against the rocks or drowned. For me once it gets to about upper thigh level you are really taking your life into your own hands wading back. 

It almost got me as a teen on many occasions. On one occasion I had to climb up the cliffs. Thank God I had rock climbing experiance. One time I did swim for it and very nearly drowned. 

Folks get caught out all the time by it. They just take the dog for a nice little walk along the beach and suddenly find themselves cut off by very strong tides pinned between that and a giant cliff. Low tide is perfectly safe. Incoming high tide is absolurely not. 

I was in one of the cave systems (not that deep really no torch needed for example) and lost track of time. By the time I got back to the entrance the waves had eroded a lot of the sand. It went from a sand walkway up to the cave to the end of the cave spitting out to a drop where I couldn't feel the bottom. Rapidly deteriorating. Cut my hands up on the rocks bouldering to the side to get around to where it was safe again. The place is a bloody death trap. 

Actually inside the water? 

On holiday I once trod on a very large stingray. Maybe 40cm across? Luckily I trod on part of it that wasn't the stinger and didn't step down hard - it simply felt my foot and split. I had no idea it was even there until i saw and felt it moving. 

When I was maybe 14, I was at the beach and ran down into the water while my mam was messing around doing something. I am standing out there chest high in the water waving and my mam just starts screaming. I didn't even notice at the time but I was basically standing in the middle of a jellyfish swarm. I know they weren't there when I got into the water. I am not *that* oblivious. The jellyfish were not harmful a bit of vinegar (I think) and the sting doesn't even hurt anymore. My mother didn't know that. I didn't get stung but she did when she charged into the water to drag me out while I was just calmly and slowly exiting. Apparently calm movements were not appropriate for the situation in her eyes. 

I did a tour of the local lifeguard place once and those folks have one hell of a dark humor. What stuck with me though; the main boat they use has a small sealed cabin. Apparently they could fit like 30 people on as rescues Inc staff. 6 of us were on (Inc staff) and it was uncomfortably snug. They then go on to say that the control cabin is sealed but most rescues would be on the deck part. If conditions caused a flip the crew would be safe, right the boat, and then buzz around picking eveyone back out of the water. To me this both makes absolute sense and also is very distressing. Imagine nearly drowning and then being punted back into the ocean along with God knows how many people. Horrifying. 

Octopus are also super smart. I saw one on a dive once, a daytime dive, just mooching around. As we approached it took off (no ink tho) towards this random rock maybe 5m away. We followed at a distance and I saw it dive into a hole in that rock and then *pick up a rock from inside the hole and use it to plug the hole from the inside*. Just **slam** no soliciting. 

Let me tell you that hysterical laughter with a regulator isn't ideal. Only one other person on the dive saw it and was also in fits. Nobody knew why both of us had suddenly gotten ourselves into apparent distress at the exact same time. You won't drown or anything but it can be a little uncomfortable and other folks will think you are in trouble esp if your mask starts to fill up as mine did. We had to end the dive a bit early because the hysterical laughter used up more oxygen than was expected. We gave a bunch of ok's but you could tell eveyone else was on edge and keeping a close eye. My mam was with me on that dive and wouldn't ever get more than about 2ft from me after it. Presumably worried I will drown. She still complains about it *'I thought you were having a seizure'*. 

The good side of the octopus incident is that folks knew exactly what to do and eveyone sprung into action. I was offered several spare regs pretty much the moment folks noticed my breathing and body position was incorrect the dive group split into 2 to deal with each of us seperatly. Someone got right up in my face and looked me in the eyes and checked all my kit to try and figure out the issue and folks prepared the inital steps to quit the dive. I gave the OK multiple times but nobody fully belived me which I kinda get. I had to bat my mam away from my float vest because she was ready to make me go up regardless of my opinion of the matter (I am an adult and was at the time but some habits I guess admittedly I would have done exactly the same to her if I thought she was going to drown). It wasn't scary for me but it was for her. She was of the opinion she was watching her eldest child about to die. For the entire rest of the dive if I so much as paused she was all over me like a rash!"

I was nervous initially when visited my first wreck as I thought I would find them foreboding and spooky (like if you stand next to a big truck or a train that’s parked!) but as soon as the wreck loomed out of the blue I was excited to go inside. 

My spookiest experience was diving a wreck off Gozo, Malta. I was down in the engine room of a 58m-long passenger ship, c40m deep at that point in the dive. It was dark, we were early in the day but some silt disturbed and vis was poor in the room. The ship is at a slight list, and as we circled the engine room and went to go back up my brain scrambled at the slightly off-level angle of the stairs as they came into view. 

I felt a pang of pure confusion and realised it was potentially the effects of disorientation mixed with gas-narcosis (40m here). 

I had to say to myself ‘hey, you know what this is, it’s fine’ followed my Buddy to the deck above and felt fine after that. 

I’m fortunate to be diving with a very experienced buddy (DM) and guide and have visited that particular wreck a number of times. It was the first time I had recognised feeling narc’ed and made me a better diver for the experience- the moment of pure brain fog was a reminder that shit can get serious very quickly at any depth. I can imagine that my short moment of disorientation mixed with challenging conditions or gear malfunction would have been a problem. 

If you want to see the stairs and wreck there’s loads of  pics online- search ‘MV Karwela’ and you’ll see!"

I'm going out on the great barrier reef tomorrow and I'm hoping one of the dives will be a SCUBA drift dive. Basically you get dropped usually directly in deep water and the current pulls you along the ocean wall you're diving against to where the boat picks you up again.

However, sometimes on drift dives, you start just in a shallow coral outcrop. You drop in where it's maybe 10m deep, then you swim towards the outer edge of the reef and....nothing. There is a literal cliff that drops off from 10m down to about 1000ft or more that fades from light blue to inky black as you look down. Because the bottom continues out due to the reef several miles out from the shore, there's no continental shelf gradual drop off. When the reef ends, there's nothing but a cliff 1000ft or more deep. You drift along this cliff and stay above 30m to see the corals, plants and wildlife that live along the edge. Because of the current, nutrients are floating by everyday constantly refreshed, so the wildlife is abundant.

When you come from the shallows and reach the cliff it is exhilarating. I don't find it terrifying, because I feel at home in the water and the ocean doesn't scare me (some of the things in it do...). I get this enormous sense of...emptiness. But not fear. If anything, loneliness. Because when you're looking out from that shelf, the next thing you would reach if you swam directly out is Peru or Chile nearly 11000 miles away...."

He had this cool diving watch, which gave you active depth readings, so while swimming i'd go subsurface and touch the ocean floor, check the depth and come back up. 10feet....20feet and then we reached this little bump, in the middle of the sea and the water was at knee level - so we had to walk across it. After walking for maybe 20 metres - it just disappeared, and there was a bottomless drop, i couldn't see the ocean floor. It was spooky but freeing of sorts, i love the ocean. We continued swimming for maybe an hour more and came back to the shore. One of my favourite memories"

Not “might”. IIRC tiger sharks always show up when the turtles lay eggs, to catch them as they leave and are too exhausted to evade them.

I grew on air force bases and as a kid I had two catastrophic planes crashes close enough to my house to see the smoke cloud come up: a KC-135 and a B52. Both were full losses and caused by pilots pulling their planes into low altitude turns past the safe turn radius for the aircraft.

[NSFW footage of the B52 crashing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0O18pQUzS8). I didn't see the plane crash, but did see the blast and mushroom cloud and had a horrifying fraction of a second where I thought that we'd been nuked because of the perfect large mushroom cloud it made.

Weird but true story: ~~The pilot~~ [A crew member](https://www.doctoraviation.com/the-thunderhawk-crash-of-1987/) of the KC-135 couldn't fly that day, but he was still killed because the plane crashed onto his car.

IIRC both crashes together led to limitation in low-level stunt flying of large aircraft over military bases."

I grew on air force bases and as a kid I had two catastrophic planes crashes close enough to my house to see the smoke cloud come up: a KC-135 and a B52. Both were full losses and caused by pilots pulling their planes into low altitude turns past the safe turn radius for the aircraft.

[NSFW footage of the B52 crashing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D0O18pQUzS8). I didn't see the plane crash, but did see the blast and mushroom cloud and had a horrifying fraction of a second where I thought that we'd been nuked because of the perfect large mushroom cloud it made.

Weird but true story: ~~The pilot~~ [A crew member](https://www.doctoraviation.com/the-thunderhawk-crash-of-1987/) of the KC-135 couldn't fly that day, but he was still killed because the plane crashed onto his car.

IIRC both crashes together led to limitation in low-level stunt flying of large aircraft over military bases."

Hey guys! You should go to your local library.

There's a range of answer here but just so you know:

1. It's more than just books. Pretty much any kind of media is available including, in some cases, video games.
2. They have a ton of resources otherwise. This varies, of course, from place to place. For example, our library lends out cookware--so if you want to learn how to use it, or just need it for one meal but don't need to buy it, or whatever--you can do so.
3. There's *tons* of programs available. Just this week they did things about genealogy, had an author of local history visit, showed a classic movie, etc. All for free.

If you are comfortable doing so, I recommend visiting. There was a huge loss of engagement due to COVID and even if you don't want to visit in person, check out what they have via online resources. I guarantee there's something there you didn't expect."

Our local public library mostly caters to the very young and very old - so basically grandparents dropping by with their grandchildren. Everyone else gave up on it, because there wasn't really anything for them there, leading the library to think people between 12 and 60 simply weren't interested and reducing their relevancy to those demographics even further by thinning out the collection and even removing big chunks of it altogether. And yeah, sure, interlibrary loans are a thing, but if you're a student it's cheaper and more convenient to just use your school/college/university library instead.

Hey guys! You should go to your local library.

There's a range of answer here but just so you know:

1. It's more than just books. Pretty much any kind of media is available including, in some cases, video games.
2. They have a ton of resources otherwise. This varies, of course, from place to place. For example, our library lends out cookware--so if you want to learn how to use it, or just need it for one meal but don't need to buy it, or whatever--you can do so.
3. There's *tons* of programs available. Just this week they did things about genealogy, had an author of local history visit, showed a classic movie, etc. All for free.

If you are comfortable doing so, I recommend visiting. There was a huge loss of engagement due to COVID and even if you don't want to visit in person, check out what they have via online resources. I guarantee there's something there you didn't expect."

Everyone else gave up on it, because there wasn't really anything for them there, leading the library to think people between 12 and 60 simply weren't interested and reducing their relevancy to those demographics even further by thinning out the collection and even removing big chunks of it altogether. And yeah, sure, interlibrary loans are a thing, but if you're a student it's cheaper and more convenient to just use your school/college/university library instead.

I say this because I had Radio 4 on and they were talking about how libraries are important within the context of 'social infrastructure.'

The answer for me is very rarely. I used to use them all the time, but now the Internet / ebooks have killed it for me.

I'm sad about that as I love libraries, but I don't have the time to go to my local ones just to increase footfall.

In general, I think they are very good."

Hey guys! You should go to your local library.

There's a range of answer here but just so you know:

1. It's more than just books. Pretty much any kind of media is available including, in some cases, video games.
2. They have a ton of resources otherwise. This varies, of course, from place to place. For example, our library lends out cookware--so if you want to learn how to use it, or just need it for one meal but don't need to buy it, or whatever--you can do so.
3. There's *tons* of programs available. Just this week they did things about genealogy, had an author of local history visit, showed a classic movie, etc. All for free.

If you are comfortable doing so, I recommend visiting. There was a huge loss of engagement due to COVID and even if you don't want to visit in person, check out what they have via online resources. I guarantee there's something there you didn't expect."

Our local public library mostly caters to the very young and very old - so basically grandparents dropping by with their grandchildren. Everyone else gave up on it, because there wasn't really anything for them there, leading the library to think people between 12 and 60 simply weren't interested and reducing their relevancy to those demographics even further by thinning out the collection and even removing big chunks of it altogether. And yeah, sure, interlibrary loans are a thing, but if you're a student it's cheaper and more convenient to just use your school/college/university library instead.

Hey guys! You should go to your local library.

There's a range of answer here but just so you know:

1. It's more than just books. Pretty much any kind of media is available including, in some cases, video games.
2. They have a ton of resources otherwise. This varies, of course, from place to place. For example, our library lends out cookware--so if you want to learn how to use it, or just need it for one meal but don't need to buy it, or whatever--you can do so.
3. There's *tons* of programs available. Just this week they did things about genealogy, had an author of local history visit, showed a classic movie, etc. All for free.

If you are comfortable doing so, I recommend visiting. There was a huge loss of engagement due to COVID and even if you don't want to visit in person, check out what they have via online resources. I guarantee there's something there you didn't expect."

Our local public library mostly caters to the very young and very old - so basically grandparents dropping by with their grandchildren. Everyone else gave up on it, because there wasn't really anything for them there, leading the library to think people between 12 and 60 simply weren't interested and reducing their relevancy to those demographics even further by thinning out the collection and even removing big chunks of it altogether. And yeah, sure, interlibrary loans are a thing, but if you're a student it's cheaper and more convenient to just use your school/college/university library instead.

Hey guys! You should go to your local library.

There's a range of answer here but just so you know:

1. It's more than just books. Pretty much any kind of media is available including, in some cases, video games.
2. They have a ton of resources otherwise. This varies, of course, from place to place. For example, our library lends out cookware--so if you want to learn how to use it, or just need it for one meal but don't need to buy it, or whatever--you can do so.
3. There's *tons* of programs available. Just this week they did things about genealogy, had an author of local history visit, showed a classic movie, etc. All for free.

If you are comfortable doing so, I recommend visiting. There was a huge loss of engagement due to COVID and even if you don't want to visit in person, check out what they have via online resources. I guarantee there's something there you didn't expect."

Our local public library mostly caters to the very young and very old - so basically grandparents dropping by with their grandchildren. Everyone else gave up on it, because there wasn't really anything for them there, leading the library to think people between 12 and 60 simply weren't interested and reducing their relevancy to those demographics even further by thinning out the collection and even removing big chunks of it altogether. And yeah, sure, interlibrary loans are a thing, but if you're a student it's cheaper and more convenient to just use your school/college/university library instead. If you just like reading, you're better off shopping at the local charity shop and using the little library boxes people put up themselves."

Hey guys! You should go to your local library.

There's a range of answer here but just so you know:

1. It's more than just books. Pretty much any kind of media is available including, in some cases, video games.
2. They have a ton of resources otherwise. This varies, of course, from place to place. For example, our library lends out cookware--so if you want to learn how to use it, or just need it for one meal but don't need to buy it, or whatever--you can do so.
3. There's *tons* of programs available. Just this week they did things about genealogy, had an author of local history visit, showed a classic movie, etc. All for free.

If you are comfortable doing so, I recommend visiting. There was a huge loss of engagement due to COVID and even if you don't want to visit in person, check out what they have via online resources. I guarantee there's something there you didn't expect."

I didn't participate in any of the shows because I didn't feel to do so 
So I entered the library and thought I would give a book a shot and read it 

To my surprise I found a book talking about America and it was focused on Abraham Lincoln the most

Everyone else gave up on it, because there wasn't really anything for them there, leading the library to think people between 12 and 60 simply weren't interested and reducing their relevancy to those demographics even further by thinning out the collection and even removing big chunks of it altogether. And yeah, sure, interlibrary loans are a thing, but if you're a student it's cheaper and more convenient to just use your school/college/university library instead.

Hey guys! You should go to your local library.

There's a range of answer here but just so you know:

1. It's more than just books. Pretty much any kind of media is available including, in some cases, video games.
2. They have a ton of resources otherwise. This varies, of course, from place to place. For example, our library lends out cookware--so if you want to learn how to use it, or just need it for one meal but don't need to buy it, or whatever--you can do so.
3. There's *tons* of programs available. Just this week they did things about genealogy, had an author of local history visit, showed a classic movie, etc. All for free.

If you are comfortable doing so, I recommend visiting. There was a huge loss of engagement due to COVID and even if you don't want to visit in person, check out what they have via online resources. I guarantee there's something there you didn't expect."

Hey guys! You should go to your local library.

There's a range of answer here but just so you know:

1. It's more than just books. Pretty much any kind of media is available including, in some cases, video games.
2. They have a ton of resources otherwise. This varies, of course, from place to place. For example, our library lends out cookware--so if you want to learn how to use it, or just need it for one meal but don't need to buy it, or whatever--you can do so.
3. There's *tons* of programs available. Just this week they did things about genealogy, had an author of local history visit, showed a classic movie, etc. All for free.

If you are comfortable doing so, I recommend visiting. There was a huge loss of engagement due to COVID and even if you don't want to visit in person, check out what they have via online resources. I guarantee there's something there you didn't expect."

Our local public library mostly caters to the very young and very old - so basically grandparents dropping by with their grandchildren. Everyone else gave up on it, because there wasn't really anything for them there, leading the library to think people between 12 and 60 simply weren't interested and reducing their relevancy to those demographics even further by thinning out the collection and even removing big chunks of it altogether. And yeah, sure, interlibrary loans are a thing, but if you're a student it's cheaper and more convenient to just use your school/college/university library instead.

Hey guys! You should go to your local library.

There's a range of answer here but just so you know:

1. It's more than just books. Pretty much any kind of media is available including, in some cases, video games.
2. They have a ton of resources otherwise. This varies, of course, from place to place. For example, our library lends out cookware--so if you want to learn how to use it, or just need it for one meal but don't need to buy it, or whatever--you can do so.
3. There's *tons* of programs available. Just this week they did things about genealogy, had an author of local history visit, showed a classic movie, etc. All for free.

If you are comfortable doing so, I recommend visiting. There was a huge loss of engagement due to COVID and even if you don't want to visit in person, check out what they have via online resources. I guarantee there's something there you didn't expect."

Our local public library mostly caters to the very young and very old - so basically grandparents dropping by with their grandchildren. Everyone else gave up on it, because there wasn't really anything for them there, leading the library to think people between 12 and 60 simply weren't interested and reducing their relevancy to those demographics even further by thinning out the collection and even removing big chunks of it altogether. And yeah, sure, interlibrary loans are a thing, but if you're a student it's cheaper and more convenient to just use your school/college/university library instead.

Hey guys! You should go to your local library.

There's a range of answer here but just so you know:

1. It's more than just books. Pretty much any kind of media is available including, in some cases, video games.
2. They have a ton of resources otherwise. This varies, of course, from place to place. For example, our library lends out cookware--so if you want to learn how to use it, or just need it for one meal but don't need to buy it, or whatever--you can do so.
3. There's *tons* of programs available. Just this week they did things about genealogy, had an author of local history visit, showed a classic movie, etc. All for free.

If you are comfortable doing so, I recommend visiting. There was a huge loss of engagement due to COVID and even if you don't want to visit in person, check out what they have via online resources. I guarantee there's something there you didn't expect."

And yeah, sure, interlibrary loans are a thing, but if you're a student it's cheaper and more convenient to just use your school/college/university library instead. If you just like reading, you're better off shopping at the local charity shop and using the little library boxes people put up themselves."

Hey guys! You should go to your local library.

There's a range of answer here but just so you know:

1. It's more than just books. Pretty much any kind of media is available including, in some cases, video games.
2. They have a ton of resources otherwise. This varies, of course, from place to place. For example, our library lends out cookware--so if you want to learn how to use it, or just need it for one meal but don't need to buy it, or whatever--you can do so.
3. There's *tons* of programs available. Just this week they did things about genealogy, had an author of local history visit, showed a classic movie, etc. All for free.

If you are comfortable doing so, I recommend visiting. There was a huge loss of engagement due to COVID and even if you don't want to visit in person, check out what they have via online resources. I guarantee there's something there you didn't expect."

We didn't find anywhere to train for the shows so we trained at our local library it had some like open area outside and we trained in that open area

I didn't participate in any of the shows because I didn't feel to do so 
So I entered the library and thought I would give a book a shot and read it 

To my surprise I found a book talking about America and it was focused on Abraham Lincoln the most 
We trained like 4 times a week so everytime we went there I read pages of the book 
Too bad I didn't finish the book and I read a decent amount after the last time I got kicked out for not owning an ID"

Our local public library mostly caters to the very young and very old - so basically grandparents dropping by with their grandchildren. Everyone else gave up on it, because there wasn't really anything for them there, leading the library to think people between 12 and 60 simply weren't interested and reducing their relevancy to those demographics even further by thinning out the collection and even removing big chunks of it altogether. And yeah, sure, interlibrary loans are a thing, but if you're a student it's cheaper and more convenient to just use your school/college/university library instead.

After the reporter asked the first question, Lavrov was basically spouting the same lie, that they do this because some countries (wink wink) does not adhere to the Minsk Agreement, and they do this to protect the integrity of sovereignty and territory (didn’t say of whom though).

And the UNSG jumped in and said there are a lot of ways under UN Charter to resolve grievances and speaking of integrity of sovereignty and territory he’d like to remind everyone that it’s Russian troops in Ukraine not the other way around.

Edit: replying to a pro Russian tankie below, and think the truth needs more visibility, so decided to copy it here:

[ Russia didn’t go any further into Georgia in 2008 precisely because there was US troop in Georgia at the time for a military exercise with Georgia and Ukraine. To think Russia wouldn’t go any further in Ukraine (BTW further than what? They literally was gonna occupy the capital) without western support is idiotic.

Also, whether you agree to US action or not, US intervention in Yugoslavia, Kuwait, Syria, Lybia, Afghanistan all have UNSC resolution granting the permission for intervention (remember Russia has the power to veto, but they abstained or voted for these resolutions) , does Russia have that for invasion of Georgia and Ukraine? Hmm?]"

After the reporter asked the first question, Lavrov was basically spouting the same lie, that they do this because some countries (wink wink) does not adhere to the Minsk Agreement, and they do this to protect the integrity of sovereignty and territory (didn’t say of whom though).

And the UNSG jumped in and said there are a lot of ways under UN Charter to resolve grievances and speaking of integrity of sovereignty and territory he’d like to remind everyone that it’s Russian troops in Ukraine not the other way around.

Edit: replying to a pro Russian tankie below, and think the truth needs more visibility, so decided to copy it here:

[ Russia didn’t go any further into Georgia in 2008 precisely because there was US troop in Georgia at the time for a military exercise with Georgia and Ukraine. To think Russia wouldn’t go any further in Ukraine (BTW further than what? They literally was gonna occupy the capital) without western support is idiotic.

Also, whether you agree to US action or not, US intervention in Yugoslavia, Kuwait, Syria, Lybia, Afghanistan all have UNSC resolution granting the permission for intervention (remember Russia has the power to veto, but they abstained or voted for these resolutions) , does Russia have that for invasion of Georgia and Ukraine? Hmm?]"

After the reporter asked the first question, Lavrov was basically spouting the same lie, that they do this because some countries (wink wink) does not adhere to the Minsk Agreement, and they do this to protect the integrity of sovereignty and territory (didn’t say of whom though).

And the UNSG jumped in and said there are a lot of ways under UN Charter to resolve grievances and speaking of integrity of sovereignty and territory he’d like to remind everyone that it’s Russian troops in Ukraine not the other way around.

Edit: replying to a pro Russian tankie below, and think the truth needs more visibility, so decided to copy it here:

[ Russia didn’t go any further into Georgia in 2008 precisely because there was US troop in Georgia at the time for a military exercise with Georgia and Ukraine. To think Russia wouldn’t go any further in Ukraine (BTW further than what? They literally was gonna occupy the capital) without western support is idiotic.

Also, whether you agree to US action or not, US intervention in Yugoslavia, Kuwait, Syria, Lybia, Afghanistan all have UNSC resolution granting the permission for intervention (remember Russia has the power to veto, but they abstained or voted for these resolutions) , does Russia have that for invasion of Georgia and Ukraine? Hmm?]"

After the reporter asked the first question, Lavrov was basically spouting the same lie, that they do this because some countries (wink wink) does not adhere to the Minsk Agreement, and they do this to protect the integrity of sovereignty and territory (didn’t say of whom though).

And the UNSG jumped in and said there are a lot of ways under UN Charter to resolve grievances and speaking of integrity of sovereignty and territory he’d like to remind everyone that it’s Russian troops in Ukraine not the other way around.

Edit: replying to a pro Russian tankie below, and think the truth needs more visibility, so decided to copy it here:

[ Russia didn’t go any further into Georgia in 2008 precisely because there was US troop in Georgia at the time for a military exercise with Georgia and Ukraine. To think Russia wouldn’t go any further in Ukraine (BTW further than what? They literally was gonna occupy the capital) without western support is idiotic.

Also, whether you agree to US action or not, US intervention in Yugoslavia, Kuwait, Syria, Lybia, Afghanistan all have UNSC resolution granting the permission for intervention (remember Russia has the power to veto, but they abstained or voted for these resolutions) , does Russia have that for invasion of Georgia and Ukraine? Hmm?]"

After the reporter asked the first question, Lavrov was basically spouting the same lie, that they do this because some countries (wink wink) does not adhere to the Minsk Agreement, and they do this to protect the integrity of sovereignty and territory (didn’t say of whom though).

And the UNSG jumped in and said there are a lot of ways under UN Charter to resolve grievances and speaking of integrity of sovereignty and territory he’d like to remind everyone that it’s Russian troops in Ukraine not the other way around.

Edit: replying to a pro Russian tankie below, and think the truth needs more visibility, so decided to copy it here:

[ Russia didn’t go any further into Georgia in 2008 precisely because there was US troop in Georgia at the time for a military exercise with Georgia and Ukraine. To think Russia wouldn’t go any further in Ukraine (BTW further than what? They literally was gonna occupy the capital) without western support is idiotic.

Also, whether you agree to US action or not, US intervention in Yugoslavia, Kuwait, Syria, Lybia, Afghanistan all have UNSC resolution granting the permission for intervention (remember Russia has the power to veto, but they abstained or voted for these resolutions) , does Russia have that for invasion of Georgia and Ukraine?

When it came time to decide what to do when our lease ended, I chose to move home to be with my family. We broke it off, she moved out, and two days later I was diagnosed with cancer. 

I know it sounds bad, but I’m better for having gone through it. I’ll always hold that cancer was one of the best things to happen to me."

The last ten were devoid of any love, warmth, or caring. I (M53) did not want to get divorced and figured this was just the way the rest of my life would be. 

We were taking our third shot at marriage counseling and after a few months, my wife says she has to quit counseling because she wants to attend a meditation class at the same time. She had something better to do than work on our marriage. 

That's when it hit me that she didn't GAF at all about our marriage and I decided that I did not want that to be the rest of my life. 

We're currently 2 1/2 years into divorce. It's painful and expensive. But personally I've never been happier. I am leading my best life. So so glad I decided to move on."

One day I was cleaning up around the house and noticed that she had left her computer open and saw some messages between her and a guy she plays games with talking about some things that I would rather not repeat. When I confronted her about it, I was gaslit and made out to be crazy. I knew then it was the beginning of the end. A year and a half later I finally had enough evidence and she admitted to cheating on me for a year and a half. 6 months before our wedding. I'm still not over it after a year and a half later and I genuinely don't think I'll be able to trust the same again."

She started being very rude and I was used to it at that point so I was just taking it, waiting for her to calm down.  All of a sudden her dad says ""Why are you talking to him like that?

The real issue was that I had seen his friends take really poor care of him when he was fucked up and I didn’t trust them at all.

The first time it happened, I was so upset and I explained how i wasn’t mad that he was out with his friends but I was worried that I didn’t know if he was ok. (They would drink and sometimes do light drugs.) I had zero concern about cheating or other women and I completely understand friend time. The real issue was that I had seen his friends take really poor care of him when he was fucked up and I didn’t trust them at all. He said that he was sorry and he would be a better communicator and he didn’t want me to worry. Then he did the exact same thing the next week. 

There were other issues in the relationship but that was the straw that broke the camels back. I couldn’t picture myself laying in bed at 3am crying about him from anxiety over his well-being weekend after weekend when he cared so little about my feelings that he couldn’t even bother to send me one text or wake me up when he was home.

The first time it happened, I was so upset and I explained how i wasn’t mad that he was out with his friends but I was worried that I didn’t know if he was ok. (They would drink and sometimes do light drugs.) I had zero concern about cheating or other women and I completely understand friend time. The real issue was that I had seen his friends take really poor care of him when he was fucked up and I didn’t trust them at all. He said that he was sorry and he would be a better communicator and he didn’t want me to worry. Then he did the exact same thing the next week. 

There were other issues in the relationship but that was the straw that broke the camels back. I couldn’t picture myself laying in bed at 3am crying about him from anxiety over his well-being weekend after weekend when he cared so little about my feelings that he couldn’t even bother to send me one text or wake me up when he was home. I had to wake up in the morning still no text or calls, my heart beating out of my chest as I check to see if he’s asleep on the couch.

Edit: aaand his ears must have been burning. Last night he accidentally sent me a text that was meant for his new girlfriend <U+0001F644>"

She didn’t come with me to any appointments because she didn’t want to miss class. She was my best friend and the only person in the city who I told about what was happening. She, however, told several of her friends and classmates and let the news spread through our program (I think she liked the second-hand sympathy). She minimized everything, told me I was overreacting when I went to her for support, and told me I’d feel better if I just stopped touching the mass. When it came time to decide what to do when our lease ended, I chose to move home to be with my family. We broke it off, she moved out, and two days later I was diagnosed with cancer. 

I know it sounds bad, but I’m better for having gone through it. I’ll always hold that cancer was one of the best things to happen to me."

The Dark is Rising is a series of children's novels written by Susan Cooper in the 1970s, and is awesome. It's full of Celtic mythology, horrific demons, strange magic, and the growing insanity of an approaching age of chaos.

It would be a very long post if I tried to describe everything the movie gets laughably wrong, so I'll just mention that the serious, stoic main character is now a small American child who shoots magic around while going ""KEWL!"" a lot, and that the scriptwriter who adapted the book never actually finished reading it because he thinks fantasy is ""boring"".

The Neverending Story because it's only the first half of the story, doesn't follow the story very well at all, and was so bad that the author Michael Ende wanted his name removed from it altogether. Which is why most people don't even know that the movie is loosely based on the first half of a much darker book. It still blows me away that the one section of the story that would have been the absolute best for film, the lion with a mane of fire who burns the world every day and dies every night and allows a forest to grow, doesn't make it to the movies. My recollection may be inaccurate there, but it still would have been an awesome part of the movie.

And then there's David Lynch's Dune. Dune will never translate well into a movie, no matter how much money is thrown at it. But that one stands out as particularly bad. The Weirding Way is a martial art - not a microphone you yell into to make lasers. The Bene Gesserit are highly adept martial artists, skilled lovers, geneticists, and political manipulators - not bald Catholics with RBF and weird clothes. The part that they got right though, the guy who played the Baron Harkonnen, that was *absolutely* spot on. He nailed the performance."

I remember being a teenager back in 2009 I went to see this giant turd at the theater. 

There is so much wrong with this ""adaptation"" it only has the names of the characters in common to the source material.



Who the fuck thought it was a good idea to make Goku a high schooler?! Have him have a crush on a girl?!? He's not even supposed to know what the fuck a girl is at the beginning.

 HAVE HIM GO TO PARTIES??? BE THE WEIRDO **VICTIM** AT SCHOOL???????

His Oozaru form isn't a gigantic monkey as big as a 5 story flat, no, it's a 2m tall were-ape, like bro wtf.

Kamehameha is erection powered air-bending like WHAT THE FUCK were they thinking?!

Promethium orbs?!?!?!?!

Also why is the movie so fucking unfun? Dragon ball is a fun fucking adventure full of hilarious moments and jokes.

I'm going out on the great barrier reef tomorrow and I'm hoping one of the dives will be a SCUBA drift dive. Basically you get dropped usually directly in deep water and the current pulls you along the ocean wall you're diving against to where the boat picks you up again.

However, sometimes on drift dives, you start just in a shallow coral outcrop. You drop in where it's maybe 10m deep, then you swim towards the outer edge of the reef and....nothing. There is a literal cliff that drops off from 10m down to about 1000ft or more that fades from light blue to inky black as you look down. Because the bottom continues out due to the reef several miles out from the shore, there's no continental shelf gradual drop off. When the reef ends, there's nothing but a cliff 1000ft or more deep. You drift along this cliff and stay above 30m to see the corals, plants and wildlife that live along the edge. Because of the current, nutrients are floating by everyday constantly refreshed, so the wildlife is abundant.

When you come from the shallows and reach the cliff it is exhilarating. I don't find it terrifying, because I feel at home in the water and the ocean doesn't scare me (some of the things in it do...). I get this enormous sense of...emptiness. But not fear.

Their extinction was inevitable, as humanity conquered and changed landscapes, and eliminated populations of any animals that interfered with agriculture and peaceful living. The taurine cattle we've replaced them with are soft, domestic creatures that lack the power and capability of those fearsome beasts, and exist explicitly because we have created them for our uses in food and labor.

So, when we stop consuming them (or if, but it seems like, in the long run, it could happen), their numbers will diminish and dwindle to a population of adored pets, ever smaller and more foreign from their previous forms, until they will scarcely be recognizable as the same animal. Then, having forever altered their species twice, little of the previous two eras of cattle will remain.

Not necessarily the hardest area of the game, but it’s easily the most aggravating part of the game due to the absurd number of statues throwing poison at you that respawn when you die (though not when you rest at a bonfire), meaning every death takes you at least five minutes to get you back to the boss fight. Throw in multiple invaders who are complete pains in the arse to fight, the boss being a pain to fight (not necessarily difficult, but having fire pits in his arena which can deal you damage and which you likely will walk into by accident because you’re too busy focusing on the boss is a major dick move) and the area being mandatory to complete the game (unless you get enough souls in your soul memory…) and you have a candidate for possibly the worst area in the entire game."

This was an early, sprite-based FPS with no jumping mechanics, but it still had gravity and inertia so you could still run over a gap and onto a ledge.

So Marathon had this level called “Colony Ship For Sale, Cheap” that had a bunch of tight, dark, winding corridors surrounding a large central room. Way up at the top of that central room was the exit. Inside that room were six zigzagging platforms, each controlled by a switch. You had to fight your way through to each switch and stop each platform at just the right height to form “stairs” to get to the exit. Also those corridors were filled with little, cloaked, suicide units that could nearly kill 1HK you with full shields and there was only one shield recharger."

Just getting to the warp pipe is already a chore. You gotta keep yoshi alive by not falling off boats to get him to the island where the pipe’s at.

Then the actual level itself is pure torture. You die if you touch the water (just like your pal yoshi) so you learn and repeat with TAS-like precision after trying over and over again. If you try to slow your lily pad down by spraying your water you run the risk of running out of time and the pad disintegrating and you dying in the toxic water.

Worst level in that game ever.

Honestly, if they would just tune down the damage of her Waterfowl Dance it'd be fine. That attack either needs to do *way* less damage or track the player less. It doesn't advertise what the player needs to do to avoid it *at all*, and it will one-combo down a player's full health bar even if they have high Vigor and heavy armor on. 

All of her other attacks are fine. That one is just... I genuinely can't think of any boss in any other FromSoft game that has such a bizarrely hard to avoid attack. It's like they let the Nioh designers come up with one boss and they decided to port William's ridiculous stagger to the game."

 The original plan for this was to have two ""challenges"" the player had to beat in order to reach the final secret level. The doors flanking the terminal lead to each of these challenges. The door to the left brought the player into a room with a deep goo pool, guarded by a very large, very pissed off Juggernaut. The trick was to make it around the room to the other side, open a door there, and flip a hidden switch which would crush the Juggernaut. A teleporter there delivered the player safely back to the terminal area. The door to the right brought the player into the single most annoying moving platform puzzle ever invented for a Marathon game - each platform moved up and down at a different rate, and the room slowly filled with goo. The player had to time each jump perfectly to make it up and across the room to reach the teleporter on the other side.

After crafting these challenges, Borzz alone play tested the map, since Your Eyes Only was a very secret level, known only to the two of us... the rest of Nardo team was in the dark until the very end of the scenario ""build"". He thought the challenges were unnecessary to ""protect"" the final secret level. So I removed the challenges altogether, the only remaining memory being the doors that lead to them.

(editors note: probably the most irritating room I've ever entered...had we not removed that platform puzzle, I'd still be trying to beat it - or warding off the mailbombs we'd be getting)"

So burning it makes it somewhat less bad for the environment. 

Leaking methane is a big problem also for gas infrastructure. Just a few percent of leakage mean that gas is just as or more climate damaging than coal. However, in many countries methane emissions are not really monitored, in contrast to CO2 emissions.

If something was to happen that prevented the normal equipment from handling gases (such as a power outage, trip of a gas compressor, high pressure in a separator), they're sent to the flare to be burned in a controlled manner so there's no chance they collect and potentially explode.

Flares are used by some to routinely dispose of produced gases, but this isn't their only purpose. In the US, routine flaring of gases is banned on deepwater platforms. 

Especially offshore, produced gases have a few uses: fuel for gas turbine generators to make electricity (the primary form of powering an offshore platform), gas lifting wells, and sales gas."

I've worked with a couple platforms that were converted to operate with a ""cold flare"" where the waste gases are used in power generation in the turbines. In an emergency situation where the system needs to blow down and exhaust to the flare, it's very important that it be lit.

The flare is normally purged with nitrogen gas so that there should be no chance of ignition in the pipe. When a blow down occurs, an automatic system launches a magnesium rod that sparks all the way up to the top and lights the flare. The system will try again a few times until it is successful. If not, someone can hopefully come out and launch an emergency rocket like in the video."

If something was to happen that prevented the normal equipment from handling gases (such as a power outage, trip of a gas compressor, high pressure in a separator), they're sent to the flare to be burned in a controlled manner so there's no chance they collect and potentially explode.

Flares are used by some to routinely dispose of produced gases, but this isn't their only purpose. In the US, routine flaring of gases is banned on deepwater platforms. 

Especially offshore, produced gases have a few uses: fuel for gas turbine generators to make electricity (the primary form of powering an offshore platform), gas lifting wells, and sales gas."

I've worked with a couple platforms that were converted to operate with a ""cold flare"" where the waste gases are used in power generation in the turbines. In an emergency situation where the system needs to blow down and exhaust to the flare, it's very important that it be lit.

The flare is normally purged with nitrogen gas so that there should be no chance of ignition in the pipe. When a blow down occurs, an automatic system launches a magnesium rod that sparks all the way up to the top and lights the flare. The system will try again a few times until it is successful. If not, someone can hopefully come out and launch an emergency rocket like in the video."
