&gt; Russia also plans two follow-on missions after Luna-25: Luna-26, a mission to study the moon from low polar orbit, and another lander mission, Luna-27, which would study lunar regolith on the surface.

&gt; &amp;quot;ESA&amp;#039;s bold action allows free countries to enhance their international lunar collaborations with hardware once destined for a Russian mission. Russia can go to the moon alone, but space exploration is best done with trusted partners, sharing in the excitement of exploration and discovery.""

&gt; Luna-25 was to open a long-term Russian lunar program that included missions to study the moon from orbit and the surface, collect and return lunar soil to Earth and work with the China National Space Administration to create an International Lunar Research Station.

&gt; Washington - Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was invited by Indonesian President Joko Widodo to attend this year&amp;#039;s Group of 20 summit in Bali, he said Wednesday, which Russian President Vladimir Putin may also attend.

&gt; Russia&amp;#039;s ambassador in Jakarta, Lyudmila Vorobieva, told reporters last month that Putin intends to go to the G20 meeting, though she acknowledged his participation will &amp;quot;Depend on many, many things, including the COVID situation.""

&gt; During a meeting of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors in Washington earlier this month, the treasury secretary and other officials walked out of the session when Russia&amp;#039;s finance minister began speaking.

I got mono, which really sucks but is relatively minor. I started getting sicker and sicker. My mom would take me to urgent care but they just kind of blew it off. I ended up turning jaundice at one point and my urine turned orange and my parents just told me I was dehydrated. I continued to get sicker and my urine ended up turning dark dark brown almost black. I could hardly move I was so weak. My heart rate was up and I was so sick. My mom took me to urgent care and they referred me to a gastro specialist because my liver was clearly having issues. The gastro specialist told my mom I needed to go to the hospital ASAP because I was critically ill. So mom my reluctantly took me. They told my mom a bunch of bad news and that they had no idea what was wrong with me but I had lost 2/3 of my blood and my organs were shutting down. They gave me a ton of pain meds to keep me comfortable. My mom told my who was out of town for work that he needed to come back because of how sick I was. He was so mad I was in the hospital and yelling and screaming at me through the phone about how I was faking it. When he got there he was rude to the medical providers and myself. One of the doctors treating me ended up telling my family I had roughly 48 hours to live and to start arranging my funeral. I was barely with it but I just remember how much I felt like a burden and I was constantly reminded of how much this whole ordeal was costing my family. A doctor finally was able to help me and treat me and I eventually got better. I needed so much help to do basic things like brush my hair, teeth, bathe, go to the bathroom, etc. I lost a lot of muscle mass. During this whole ordeal I couldn’t get past how mean my dad was and how much my family constantly reminded me that this hospital stay was so expensive and getting them in trouble with work. Between the illness and how my family acted I was so messed up from it all. It made me realize how toxic my family was and how badly I wanted out. It was so hard realizing that work/money was always more important to my family than I was. It made me become way more compassionate and self aware of how my words and actions could affect others. It wasn’t exactly overnight but it was over the course of a few months. I’m now 27 and they still remind me about how expensive it was to save me when I was sick nearly a decade ago. So yeah…. Rough stuff can really change you. Be nice and if you don’t want to be a parent then don’t."

At sixteen I started experiencing discomfort when I ate, but I brushed it off and ignored it. Discomfort slowly turned to pain, and about a month after my eighteenth birthday I got really bad really fast. Started fainting from pain when I ate or drank anything, and wound up mostly bedridden. It was hell. Four months later, doctors found it was a dying gallbladder in concert with severe, disabling IBS and milder GERD. I had a surgery to remove the dying gallbladder seven months after my nineteenth birthday. Doctors said I could easily have starved to death if it had gone on much longer, and declared me chronically ill to the point of disability. 

Shortly after I healed from the surgery, I was trying to decide whether eating a meal was really worth the physical pain or if I should lie down and have a nap for dinner instead. I remember that the sun was slanting really prettily over the countertops while I fiddled with the cabinet door. I was dizzy, leaning all my weight on the counter, watching the sunlight and mentally weighting the likelihood of fainting from either pain or from hunger, slowly realizing thag they were both somewhat likely, and it hit me really suddenly that I really almost died. If i stayed sick, I would be dead. My family would have buried me, my three year old sister would have watched my body being lowered into the ground. And the rest of my life is just gonna be this same decision, pain or hunger, multiple times every damn day. Until I die. 


It screwed with me for a minute. And I wasn't wrong either. At 21, I still faint from pain when I eat sometimes. Medications screw me up more. I'm disabled. Just gotta deal with it. But I'm married, financially stable, and unafraid of what might come. I don't fear death, but I also don't crave it. What once was overwhelming is now routine. I eat what I can, cope with the rest, and at the end of the day I'm thankful to have someone to live through it all with me."

I was born and raised in the deep south as a God-fearing, conservative. I ""knew what was right"" and defended it vehemently. I knew I was racist growing up, because I was taught others were inferior... they couldn't help it.. it is how they were bred. No, really. That's what I thought. 

Fast forward around 30 years. Trump is running for president. Wait, what? This grifter? He's well-known to be a cheat, of low-morals and only cares for himself. This is who the RNC has chosen to move forward with as their candidate of choice? The vast majority of conservatives are okay with this? People are following him and lapping up the rhetoric with cult-like enthusiasm? That moment changed my outlook on a LOT of things.

My advice to others in this situation is just to start doing something, anything. Meet as many people as you can. Figure out the kinds of folks you admire, and why you admire them. Talk to them about what drives them, their likes and dislikes,  and how they got where they are. In your journey you might find out some awesome things about yourself."

They gave me a ton of pain meds to keep me comfortable. My mom told my who was out of town for work that he needed to come back because of how sick I was. He was so mad I was in the hospital and yelling and screaming at me through the phone about how I was faking it. When he got there he was rude to the medical providers and myself.

I needed so much help to do basic things like brush my hair, teeth, bathe, go to the bathroom, etc. I lost a lot of muscle mass. During this whole ordeal I couldn’t get past how mean my dad was and how much my family constantly reminded me that this hospital stay was so expensive and getting them in trouble with work. Between the illness and how my family acted I was so messed up from it all. It made me realize how toxic my family was and how badly I wanted out. It was so hard realizing that work/money was always more important to my family than I was. It made me become way more compassionate and self aware of how my words and actions could affect others. It wasn’t exactly overnight but it was over the course of a few months. I’m now 27 and they still remind me about how expensive it was to save me when I was sick nearly a decade ago. So yeah…. Rough stuff can really change you. Be nice and if you don’t want to be a parent then don’t."

At sixteen I started experiencing discomfort when I ate, but I brushed it off and ignored it. Discomfort slowly turned to pain, and about a month after my eighteenth birthday I got really bad really fast. Started fainting from pain when I ate or drank anything, and wound up mostly bedridden. It was hell. Four months later, doctors found it was a dying gallbladder in concert with severe, disabling IBS and milder GERD. I had a surgery to remove the dying gallbladder seven months after my nineteenth birthday. Doctors said I could easily have starved to death if it had gone on much longer, and declared me chronically ill to the point of disability. 

Shortly after I healed from the surgery, I was trying to decide whether eating a meal was really worth the physical pain or if I should lie down and have a nap for dinner instead. I remember that the sun was slanting really prettily over the countertops while I fiddled with the cabinet door. I was dizzy, leaning all my weight on the counter, watching the sunlight and mentally weighting the likelihood of fainting from either pain or from hunger, slowly realizing thag they were both somewhat likely, and it hit me really suddenly that I really almost died. If i stayed sick, I would be dead. My family would have buried me, my three year old sister would have watched my body being lowered into the ground. And the rest of my life is just gonna be this same decision, pain or hunger, multiple times every damn day. Until I die. 


It screwed with me for a minute. And I wasn't wrong either. At 21, I still faint from pain when I eat sometimes. Medications screw me up more. I'm disabled. Just gotta deal with it. But I'm married, financially stable, and unafraid of what might come. I don't fear death, but I also don't crave it. What once was overwhelming is now routine. I eat what I can, cope with the rest, and at the end of the day I'm thankful to have someone to live through it all with me."

Fast forward around 30 years. Trump is running for president. Wait, what? This grifter? He's well-known to be a cheat, of low-morals and only cares for himself. This is who the RNC has chosen to move forward with as their candidate of choice? The vast majority of conservatives are okay with this? People are following him and lapping up the rhetoric with cult-like enthusiasm? That moment changed my outlook on a LOT of things.

I got mono, which really sucks but is relatively minor. I started getting sicker and sicker. My mom would take me to urgent care but they just kind of blew it off. I ended up turning jaundice at one point and my urine turned orange and my parents just told me I was dehydrated. I continued to get sicker and my urine ended up turning dark dark brown almost black. I could hardly move I was so weak. My heart rate was up and I was so sick. My mom took me to urgent care and they referred me to a gastro specialist because my liver was clearly having issues. The gastro specialist told my mom I needed to go to the hospital ASAP because I was critically ill. So mom my reluctantly took me. They told my mom a bunch of bad news and that they had no idea what was wrong with me but I had lost 2/3 of my blood and my organs were shutting down. They gave me a ton of pain meds to keep me comfortable. My mom told my who was out of town for work that he needed to come back because of how sick I was. He was so mad I was in the hospital and yelling and screaming at me through the phone about how I was faking it. When he got there he was rude to the medical providers and myself. One of the doctors treating me ended up telling my family I had roughly 48 hours to live and to start arranging my funeral. I was barely with it but I just remember how much I felt like a burden and I was constantly reminded of how much this whole ordeal was costing my family. A doctor finally was able to help me and treat me and I eventually got better. I needed so much help to do basic things like brush my hair, teeth, bathe, go to the bathroom, etc. I lost a lot of muscle mass. During this whole ordeal I couldn’t get past how mean my dad was and how much my family constantly reminded me that this hospital stay was so expensive and getting them in trouble with work. Between the illness and how my family acted I was so messed up from it all. It made me realize how toxic my family was and how badly I wanted out. It was so hard realizing that work/money was always more important to my family than I was. It made me become way more compassionate and self aware of how my words and actions could affect others. It wasn’t exactly overnight but it was over the course of a few months. I’m now 27 and they still remind me about how expensive it was to save me when I was sick nearly a decade ago. So yeah….

That was when my life changed. One day I had to decide what I was going to do with it, and I became a new person. Who I am today in no way resembles who that person was."

I know this sounds kinda weird maybe but it really helped my mental health. I have spent most of my childhood in constant really stressful situations where someone could even die which is why I was stressed all the time and missed a lot of school for a while cause I had phycosomatic stomach aches from time to time and sometimes felt like throwing up for almost a year. But smoking weed once made me get the mindset of ""just enjoy life"" and realize that things that happen just happen. Of course there were other factors but watching a video about ferbs (from Phineas and Ferb) stoic personality while I was high did a lot. I don't smoke constantly either last time was like 2 months ago."

At sixteen I started experiencing discomfort when I ate, but I brushed it off and ignored it. Discomfort slowly turned to pain, and about a month after my eighteenth birthday I got really bad really fast. Started fainting from pain when I ate or drank anything, and wound up mostly bedridden. It was hell. Four months later, doctors found it was a dying gallbladder in concert with severe, disabling IBS and milder GERD. I had a surgery to remove the dying gallbladder seven months after my nineteenth birthday. Doctors said I could easily have starved to death if it had gone on much longer, and declared me chronically ill to the point of disability. 

Shortly after I healed from the surgery, I was trying to decide whether eating a meal was really worth the physical pain or if I should lie down and have a nap for dinner instead. I remember that the sun was slanting really prettily over the countertops while I fiddled with the cabinet door. I was dizzy, leaning all my weight on the counter, watching the sunlight and mentally weighting the likelihood of fainting from either pain or from hunger, slowly realizing thag they were both somewhat likely, and it hit me really suddenly that I really almost died. If i stayed sick, I would be dead. My family would have buried me, my three year old sister would have watched my body being lowered into the ground. And the rest of my life is just gonna be this same decision, pain or hunger, multiple times every damn day. Until I die. 


It screwed with me for a minute. And I wasn't wrong either. At 21, I still faint from pain when I eat sometimes. Medications screw me up more. I'm disabled. Just gotta deal with it. But I'm married, financially stable, and unafraid of what might come. I don't fear death, but I also don't crave it. What once was overwhelming is now routine. I eat what I can, cope with the rest, and at the end of the day I'm thankful to have someone to live through it all with me."

Hear me out.

I was born and raised in the deep south as a God-fearing, conservative. I ""knew what was right"" and defended it vehemently. I knew I was racist growing up, because I was taught others were inferior... they couldn't help it.. it is how they were bred. No, really. That's what I thought. 

Fast forward around 30 years. Trump is running for president. Wait, what? This grifter? He's well-known to be a cheat, of low-morals and only cares for himself. This is who the RNC has chosen to move forward with as their candidate of choice? The vast majority of conservatives are okay with this? People are following him and lapping up the rhetoric with cult-like enthusiasm? That moment changed my outlook on a LOT of things. I did a lot of research and opened my eyes on socio-economic policies, religion and more.

Talk to them about what drives them, their likes and dislikes,  and how they got where they are. In your journey you might find out some awesome things about yourself."

I got mono, which really sucks but is relatively minor. I started getting sicker and sicker. My mom would take me to urgent care but they just kind of blew it off. I ended up turning jaundice at one point and my urine turned orange and my parents just told me I was dehydrated. I continued to get sicker and my urine ended up turning dark dark brown almost black. I could hardly move I was so weak. My heart rate was up and I was so sick. My mom took me to urgent care and they referred me to a gastro specialist because my liver was clearly having issues. The gastro specialist told my mom I needed to go to the hospital ASAP because I was critically ill. So mom my reluctantly took me. They told my mom a bunch of bad news and that they had no idea what was wrong with me but I had lost 2/3 of my blood and my organs were shutting down. They gave me a ton of pain meds to keep me comfortable. My mom told my who was out of town for work that he needed to come back because of how sick I was. He was so mad I was in the hospital and yelling and screaming at me through the phone about how I was faking it. When he got there he was rude to the medical providers and myself. One of the doctors treating me ended up telling my family I had roughly 48 hours to live and to start arranging my funeral. I was barely with it but I just remember how much I felt like a burden and I was constantly reminded of how much this whole ordeal was costing my family. A doctor finally was able to help me and treat me and I eventually got better. I needed so much help to do basic things like brush my hair, teeth, bathe, go to the bathroom, etc. I lost a lot of muscle mass. During this whole ordeal I couldn’t get past how mean my dad was and how much my family constantly reminded me that this hospital stay was so expensive and getting them in trouble with work. Between the illness and how my family acted I was so messed up from it all. It made me realize how toxic my family was and how badly I wanted out. It was so hard realizing that work/money was always more important to my family than I was. It made me become way more compassionate and self aware of how my words and actions could affect others. It wasn’t exactly overnight but it was over the course of a few months. I’m now 27 and they still remind me about how expensive it was to save me when I was sick nearly a decade ago. So yeah….

I know this sounds kinda weird maybe but it really helped my mental health. I have spent most of my childhood in constant really stressful situations where someone could even die which is why I was stressed all the time and missed a lot of school for a while cause I had phycosomatic stomach aches from time to time and sometimes felt like throwing up for almost a year. But smoking weed once made me get the mindset of ""just enjoy life"" and realize that things that happen just happen. Of course there were other factors but watching a video about ferbs (from Phineas and Ferb) stoic personality while I was high did a lot. I don't smoke constantly either last time was like 2 months ago."

At sixteen I started experiencing discomfort when I ate, but I brushed it off and ignored it. Discomfort slowly turned to pain, and about a month after my eighteenth birthday I got really bad really fast. Started fainting from pain when I ate or drank anything, and wound up mostly bedridden. It was hell. Four months later, doctors found it was a dying gallbladder in concert with severe, disabling IBS and milder GERD. I had a surgery to remove the dying gallbladder seven months after my nineteenth birthday. Doctors said I could easily have starved to death if it had gone on much longer, and declared me chronically ill to the point of disability. 

Shortly after I healed from the surgery, I was trying to decide whether eating a meal was really worth the physical pain or if I should lie down and have a nap for dinner instead. I remember that the sun was slanting really prettily over the countertops while I fiddled with the cabinet door. I was dizzy, leaning all my weight on the counter, watching the sunlight and mentally weighting the likelihood of fainting from either pain or from hunger, slowly realizing thag they were both somewhat likely, and it hit me really suddenly that I really almost died. If i stayed sick, I would be dead. My family would have buried me, my three year old sister would have watched my body being lowered into the ground. And the rest of my life is just gonna be this same decision, pain or hunger, multiple times every damn day. Until I die. 


It screwed with me for a minute. And I wasn't wrong either. At 21, I still faint from pain when I eat sometimes. Medications screw me up more. I'm disabled. Just gotta deal with it. But I'm married, financially stable, and unafraid of what might come. I don't fear death, but I also don't crave it. What once was overwhelming is now routine. I eat what I can, cope with the rest, and at the end of the day I'm thankful to have someone to live through it all with me."

Hear me out.

I was born and raised in the deep south as a God-fearing, conservative. I ""knew what was right"" and defended it vehemently. I knew I was racist growing up, because I was taught others were inferior... they couldn't help it.. it is how they were bred. No, really. That's what I thought. 

Fast forward around 30 years. Trump is running for president. Wait, what? This grifter? He's well-known to be a cheat, of low-morals and only cares for himself. This is who the RNC has chosen to move forward with as their candidate of choice? The vast majority of conservatives are okay with this? People are following him and lapping up the rhetoric with cult-like enthusiasm? That moment changed my outlook on a LOT of things. I did a lot of research and opened my eyes on socio-economic policies, religion and more.

I got mono, which really sucks but is relatively minor. I started getting sicker and sicker. My mom would take me to urgent care but they just kind of blew it off. I ended up turning jaundice at one point and my urine turned orange and my parents just told me I was dehydrated. I continued to get sicker and my urine ended up turning dark dark brown almost black. I could hardly move I was so weak. My heart rate was up and I was so sick. My mom took me to urgent care and they referred me to a gastro specialist because my liver was clearly having issues. The gastro specialist told my mom I needed to go to the hospital ASAP because I was critically ill. So mom my reluctantly took me. They told my mom a bunch of bad news and that they had no idea what was wrong with me but I had lost 2/3 of my blood and my organs were shutting down. They gave me a ton of pain meds to keep me comfortable. My mom told my who was out of town for work that he needed to come back because of how sick I was. He was so mad I was in the hospital and yelling and screaming at me through the phone about how I was faking it. When he got there he was rude to the medical providers and myself. One of the doctors treating me ended up telling my family I had roughly 48 hours to live and to start arranging my funeral. I was barely with it but I just remember how much I felt like a burden and I was constantly reminded of how much this whole ordeal was costing my family. A doctor finally was able to help me and treat me and I eventually got better. I needed so much help to do basic things like brush my hair, teeth, bathe, go to the bathroom, etc. I lost a lot of muscle mass. During this whole ordeal I couldn’t get past how mean my dad was and how much my family constantly reminded me that this hospital stay was so expensive and getting them in trouble with work. Between the illness and how my family acted I was so messed up from it all. It made me realize how toxic my family was and how badly I wanted out. It was so hard realizing that work/money was always more important to my family than I was. It made me become way more compassionate and self aware of how my words and actions could affect others. It wasn’t exactly overnight but it was over the course of a few months. I’m now 27 and they still remind me about how expensive it was to save me when I was sick nearly a decade ago. So yeah….

At sixteen I started experiencing discomfort when I ate, but I brushed it off and ignored it. Discomfort slowly turned to pain, and about a month after my eighteenth birthday I got really bad really fast. Started fainting from pain when I ate or drank anything, and wound up mostly bedridden. It was hell. Four months later, doctors found it was a dying gallbladder in concert with severe, disabling IBS and milder GERD. I had a surgery to remove the dying gallbladder seven months after my nineteenth birthday. Doctors said I could easily have starved to death if it had gone on much longer, and declared me chronically ill to the point of disability. 

Shortly after I healed from the surgery, I was trying to decide whether eating a meal was really worth the physical pain or if I should lie down and have a nap for dinner instead. I remember that the sun was slanting really prettily over the countertops while I fiddled with the cabinet door. I was dizzy, leaning all my weight on the counter, watching the sunlight and mentally weighting the likelihood of fainting from either pain or from hunger, slowly realizing thag they were both somewhat likely, and it hit me really suddenly that I really almost died. If i stayed sick, I would be dead. My family would have buried me, my three year old sister would have watched my body being lowered into the ground. And the rest of my life is just gonna be this same decision, pain or hunger, multiple times every damn day. Until I die. 


It screwed with me for a minute. And I wasn't wrong either. At 21, I still faint from pain when I eat sometimes. Medications screw me up more. I'm disabled. Just gotta deal with it. But I'm married, financially stable, and unafraid of what might come. I don't fear death, but I also don't crave it. What once was overwhelming is now routine. I eat what I can, cope with the rest, and at the end of the day I'm thankful to have someone to live through it all with me."

Fast forward around 30 years. Trump is running for president. Wait, what? This grifter? He's well-known to be a cheat, of low-morals and only cares for himself. This is who the RNC has chosen to move forward with as their candidate of choice? The vast majority of conservatives are okay with this? People are following him and lapping up the rhetoric with cult-like enthusiasm? That moment changed my outlook on a LOT of things. I did a lot of research and opened my eyes on socio-economic policies, religion and more. 

So... thanks(?) Donald."

Talk to them about what drives them, their likes and dislikes,  and how they got where they are. In your journey you might find out some awesome things about yourself."

Hunters here in Australia go out and take down feral pigs that are often larger than the hunter. I remember as a kid going with my parents to a few pig on a spit barbecues where the pig would have been at least 1.5 metres, once nearly 2 metres long - and that one was taken down by a mad bugger with his bow and arrows.

The biggest one was prepared some time around 5am, on the fire by 6, and 12 hours later was served."

Hunters here in Australia go out and take down feral pigs that are often larger than the hunter. I remember as a kid going with my parents to a few pig on a spit barbecues where the pig would have been at least 1.5 metres, once nearly 2 metres long - and that one was taken down by a mad bugger with his bow and arrows.

The biggest one was prepared some time around 5am, on the fire by 6, and 12 hours later was served."

Hunters here in Australia go out and take down feral pigs that are often larger than the hunter. I remember as a kid going with my parents to a few pig on a spit barbecues where the pig would have been at least 1.5 metres, once nearly 2 metres long - and that one was taken down by a mad bugger with his bow and arrows.

The biggest one was prepared some time around 5am, on the fire by 6, and 12 hours later was served."

Hunters here in Australia go out and take down feral pigs that are often larger than the hunter. I remember as a kid going with my parents to a few pig on a spit barbecues where the pig would have been at least 1.5 metres, once nearly 2 metres long - and that one was taken down by a mad bugger with his bow and arrows.

The biggest one was prepared some time around 5am, on the fire by 6, and 12 hours later was served."

Hunters here in Australia go out and take down feral pigs that are often larger than the hunter. I remember as a kid going with my parents to a few pig on a spit barbecues where the pig would have been at least 1.5 metres, once nearly 2 metres long - and that one was taken down by a mad bugger with his bow and arrows.

The biggest one was prepared some time around 5am, on the fire by 6, and 12 hours later was served."

He texted her, telling her to keep her distance from him.

But as of today, she still commented under his pic and so on, and I am more frustrated about the fact that she got told to back off, but still goes on to comment.

I was telling my friends how I spent around 4 hours straight at the library studying, but then corrected myself and told them I took a small break. The teacher then said I’m basically taking a break from his class, not doing my work, blah.

I honestly wouldn’t be as annoyed if this teacher was present in class, but he’s gone like 90% of the time and doesn’t really teach us (he’s a coach). He then gets annoyed when we don’t know stuff. Sorry we have to teach ourselves a hard AP class.

Also, I did put in time for his class. That’s the most annoying part. I studied my ass off for one of his tests, got a 57, decided to stop caring the last unit (he wasn’t present and I was discouraged) and I got the same score. I don’t understand the subject, which is ok (it’s a hard class), but still. 

Maybe I’m being dramatic. I get it was a joke , but I don’t really speak to that teacher and then he proceeded to call us out for making mistakes on the test in front of everyone. Maybe I need to take a step back and reevaluate the situation, but does it really matter? I graduate in a month.

I’m finally starting to accept this fact. I used to always wanna be friends with everybody. Even though I knew that the friendship was only one sided.

He texted her, telling her to keep her distance from him.

I was telling my friends how I spent around 4 hours straight at the library studying, but then corrected myself and told them I took a small break. The teacher then said I’m basically taking a break from his class, not doing my work, blah.

I honestly wouldn’t be as annoyed if this teacher was present in class, but he’s gone like 90% of the time and doesn’t really teach us (he’s a coach). He then gets annoyed when we don’t know stuff. Sorry we have to teach ourselves a hard AP class.

Also, I did put in time for his class. That’s the most annoying part. I studied my ass off for one of his tests, got a 57, decided to stop caring the last unit (he wasn’t present and I was discouraged) and I got the same score. I don’t understand the subject, which is ok (it’s a hard class), but still. 

Maybe I’m being dramatic. I get it was a joke , but I don’t really speak to that teacher and then he proceeded to call us out for making mistakes on the test in front of everyone. Maybe I need to take a step back and reevaluate the situation, but does it really matter? I graduate in a month.

I’m finally starting to accept this fact. I used to always wanna be friends with everybody. Even though I knew that the friendship was only one sided.

I was telling my friends how I spent around 4 hours straight at the library studying, but then corrected myself and told them I took a small break. The teacher then said I’m basically taking a break from his class, not doing my work, blah.

I honestly wouldn’t be as annoyed if this teacher was present in class, but he’s gone like 90% of the time and doesn’t really teach us (he’s a coach). He then gets annoyed when we don’t know stuff. Sorry we have to teach ourselves a hard AP class.

Also, I did put in time for his class. That’s the most annoying part. I studied my ass off for one of his tests, got a 57, decided to stop caring the last unit (he wasn’t present and I was discouraged) and I got the same score. I don’t understand the subject, which is ok (it’s a hard class), but still. 

Maybe I’m being dramatic. I get it was a joke , but I don’t really speak to that teacher and then he proceeded to call us out for making mistakes on the test in front of everyone. Maybe I need to take a step back and reevaluate the situation, but does it really matter? I graduate in a month.

I’m finally starting to accept this fact. I used to always wanna be friends with everybody. Even though I knew that the friendship was only one sided.

He texted her, telling her to keep her distance from him.

I was telling my friends how I spent around 4 hours straight at the library studying, but then corrected myself and told them I took a small break. The teacher then said I’m basically taking a break from his class, not doing my work, blah.

I honestly wouldn’t be as annoyed if this teacher was present in class, but he’s gone like 90% of the time and doesn’t really teach us (he’s a coach). He then gets annoyed when we don’t know stuff. Sorry we have to teach ourselves a hard AP class.

Also, I did put in time for his class. That’s the most annoying part. I studied my ass off for one of his tests, got a 57, decided to stop caring the last unit (he wasn’t present and I was discouraged) and I got the same score. I don’t understand the subject, which is ok (it’s a hard class), but still. 

Maybe I’m being dramatic. I get it was a joke , but I don’t really speak to that teacher and then he proceeded to call us out for making mistakes on the test in front of everyone. Maybe I need to take a step back and reevaluate the situation, but does it really matter? I graduate in a month.

I’m finally starting to accept this fact. I used to always wanna be friends with everybody. Even though I knew that the friendship was only one sided.

He texted her, telling her to keep her distance from him.

I was telling my friends how I spent around 4 hours straight at the library studying, but then corrected myself and told them I took a small break. The teacher then said I’m basically taking a break from his class, not doing my work, blah.

I honestly wouldn’t be as annoyed if this teacher was present in class, but he’s gone like 90% of the time and doesn’t really teach us (he’s a coach). He then gets annoyed when we don’t know stuff. Sorry we have to teach ourselves a hard AP class.

Also, I did put in time for his class. That’s the most annoying part. I studied my ass off for one of his tests, got a 57, decided to stop caring the last unit (he wasn’t present and I was discouraged) and I got the same score. I don’t understand the subject, which is ok (it’s a hard class), but still. 

Maybe I’m being dramatic. I get it was a joke , but I don’t really speak to that teacher and then he proceeded to call us out for making mistakes on the test in front of everyone. Maybe I need to take a step back and reevaluate the situation, but does it really matter? I graduate in a month.

He texted her, telling her to keep her distance from him.

I was telling my friends how I spent around 4 hours straight at the library studying, but then corrected myself and told them I took a small break. The teacher then said I’m basically taking a break from his class, not doing my work, blah.

I honestly wouldn’t be as annoyed if this teacher was present in class, but he’s gone like 90% of the time and doesn’t really teach us (he’s a coach). He then gets annoyed when we don’t know stuff. Sorry we have to teach ourselves a hard AP class.

Also, I did put in time for his class. That’s the most annoying part. I studied my ass off for one of his tests, got a 57, decided to stop caring the last unit (he wasn’t present and I was discouraged) and I got the same score. I don’t understand the subject, which is ok (it’s a hard class), but still. 

Maybe I’m being dramatic. I get it was a joke , but I don’t really speak to that teacher and then he proceeded to call us out for making mistakes on the test in front of everyone. Maybe I need to take a step back and reevaluate the situation, but does it really matter? I graduate in a month.

This was an early, sprite-based FPS with no jumping mechanics, but it still had gravity and inertia so you could still run over a gap and onto a ledge.

So Marathon had this level called “Colony Ship For Sale, Cheap” that had a bunch of tight, dark, winding corridors surrounding a large central room. Way up at the top of that central room was the exit. Inside that room were six zigzagging platforms, each controlled by a switch. You had to fight your way through to each switch and stop each platform at just the right height to form “stairs” to get to the exit. Also those corridors were filled with little, cloaked, suicide units that could nearly kill 1HK you with full shields and there was only one shield recharger."

Not necessarily the hardest area of the game, but it’s easily the most aggravating part of the game due to the absurd number of statues throwing poison at you that respawn when you die (though not when you rest at a bonfire), meaning every death takes you at least five minutes to get you back to the boss fight. Throw in multiple invaders who are complete pains in the arse to fight, the boss being a pain to fight (not necessarily difficult, but having fire pits in his arena which can deal you damage and which you likely will walk into by accident because you’re too busy focusing on the boss is a major dick move) and the area being mandatory to complete the game (unless you get enough souls in your soul memory…) and you have a candidate for possibly the worst area in the entire game."

Just getting to the warp pipe is already a chore. You gotta keep yoshi alive by not falling off boats to get him to the island where the pipe’s at.

Then the actual level itself is pure torture. You die if you touch the water (just like your pal yoshi) so you learn and repeat with TAS-like precision after trying over and over again. If you try to slow your lily pad down by spraying your water you run the risk of running out of time and the pad disintegrating and you dying in the toxic water.

Worst level in that game ever.

Honestly, if they would just tune down the damage of her Waterfowl Dance it'd be fine. That attack either needs to do *way* less damage or track the player less. It doesn't advertise what the player needs to do to avoid it *at all*, and it will one-combo down a player's full health bar even if they have high Vigor and heavy armor on. 

All of her other attacks are fine. That one is just... I genuinely can't think of any boss in any other FromSoft game that has such a bizarrely hard to avoid attack. It's like they let the Nioh designers come up with one boss and they decided to port William's ridiculous stagger to the game."

 The original plan for this was to have two ""challenges"" the player had to beat in order to reach the final secret level. The doors flanking the terminal lead to each of these challenges. The door to the left brought the player into a room with a deep goo pool, guarded by a very large, very pissed off Juggernaut. The trick was to make it around the room to the other side, open a door there, and flip a hidden switch which would crush the Juggernaut. A teleporter there delivered the player safely back to the terminal area. The door to the right brought the player into the single most annoying moving platform puzzle ever invented for a Marathon game - each platform moved up and down at a different rate, and the room slowly filled with goo. The player had to time each jump perfectly to make it up and across the room to reach the teleporter on the other side.

After crafting these challenges, Borzz alone play tested the map, since Your Eyes Only was a very secret level, known only to the two of us... the rest of Nardo team was in the dark until the very end of the scenario ""build"". He thought the challenges were unnecessary to ""protect"" the final secret level. So I removed the challenges altogether, the only remaining memory being the doors that lead to them.

(editors note: probably the most irritating room I've ever entered...had we not removed that platform puzzle, I'd still be trying to beat it - or warding off the mailbombs we'd be getting)"

Their extinction was inevitable, as humanity conquered and changed landscapes, and eliminated populations of any animals that interfered with agriculture and peaceful living. The taurine cattle we've replaced them with are soft, domestic creatures that lack the power and capability of those fearsome beasts, and exist explicitly because we have created them for our uses in food and labor.

So, when we stop consuming them (or if, but it seems like, in the long run, it could happen), their numbers will diminish and dwindle to a population of adored pets, ever smaller and more foreign from their previous forms, until they will scarcely be recognizable as the same animal. Then, having forever altered their species twice, little of the previous two eras of cattle will remain. What their existence was [will be lost](https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/2013-09-07), as tears in the rain."

Nah, its just more complicated than a single damn thing as some like to pretend in bad faith. Linking economies works if you have other friendly relations/positions going on as well alongside mutually beneficial agreements. It does not work if every damn step of the way one, or both parties views shit from a hostile and adversarial perspective, or otherwise as a zero sum equation like extremists/fundamentalists do. Yugoslavia being one of the worst examples of all sorts of shit on that end ranging from genocidal racist BS or as otherwise called ""ethnic tensions""... to a genocidal fucking level of hate, to other dysfunctions involving corruption and the consequences of long term historic and communist authoritarian era ineptitudes. I mean really as far as such things go one could have picked Somalia for a fringe example of something worse for sake of bad faith argumentation about how supposedly ""it doesn't work"" with developed nations. 

Linking economies therein works as an added guarantee, or otherwise as a means by which to reduce certain types of conflict, it is not a singular solution to a given problem outright though. What is meant by an ""added guarantee""? well simple, if its more profitable to keep a given economic and transactional relationship going than to try and go out with all out war then its by far less likely that war will occur. It does not however work when one introduced fundamentalists, and extremists in to the picture... i mean no arrangement works once such types get introduced. Hell, look at the US with what far reicht and religious fundamentalists have done to the republican party... and as a consequence the nation as a whole as warned against by Barry Goldwater like 30 years ago."

Nah, its just more complicated than a single damn thing as some like to pretend in bad faith. Linking economies works if you have other friendly relations/positions going on as well alongside mutually beneficial agreements. It does not work if every damn step of the way one, or both parties views shit from a hostile and adversarial perspective, or otherwise as a zero sum equation like extremists/fundamentalists do. Yugoslavia being one of the worst examples of all sorts of shit on that end ranging from genocidal racist BS or as otherwise called ""ethnic tensions""... to a genocidal fucking level of hate, to other dysfunctions involving corruption and the consequences of long term historic and communist authoritarian era ineptitudes. I mean really as far as such things go one could have picked Somalia for a fringe example of something worse for sake of bad faith argumentation about how supposedly ""it doesn't work"" with developed nations. 

Linking economies therein works as an added guarantee, or otherwise as a means by which to reduce certain types of conflict, it is not a singular solution to a given problem outright though. What is meant by an ""added guarantee""? well simple, if its more profitable to keep a given economic and transactional relationship going than to try and go out with all out war then its by far less likely that war will occur. It does not however work when one introduced fundamentalists, and extremists in to the picture... i mean no arrangement works once such types get introduced. Hell, look at the US with what far reicht and religious fundamentalists have done to the republican party... and as a consequence the nation as a whole as warned against by Barry Goldwater like 30 years ago."

Nah, its just more complicated than a single damn thing as some like to pretend in bad faith. Linking economies works if you have other friendly relations/positions going on as well alongside mutually beneficial agreements. It does not work if every damn step of the way one, or both parties views shit from a hostile and adversarial perspective, or otherwise as a zero sum equation like extremists/fundamentalists do. Yugoslavia being one of the worst examples of all sorts of shit on that end ranging from genocidal racist BS or as otherwise called ""ethnic tensions""... to a genocidal fucking level of hate, to other dysfunctions involving corruption and the consequences of long term historic and communist authoritarian era ineptitudes. I mean really as far as such things go one could have picked Somalia for a fringe example of something worse for sake of bad faith argumentation about how supposedly ""it doesn't work"" with developed nations. 

Linking economies therein works as an added guarantee, or otherwise as a means by which to reduce certain types of conflict, it is not a singular solution to a given problem outright though. What is meant by an ""added guarantee""? well simple, if its more profitable to keep a given economic and transactional relationship going than to try and go out with all out war then its by far less likely that war will occur. It does not however work when one introduced fundamentalists, and extremists in to the picture... i mean no arrangement works once such types get introduced. Hell, look at the US with what far reicht and religious fundamentalists have done to the republican party... and as a consequence the nation as a whole as warned against by Barry Goldwater like 30 years ago."

Sometimes it was even rubbing its body up against me.  If you're not familiar with them, they're kind of like giant piranhas, they're ferocious predators with similar really sharp teeth.  They're *usually* not dangerous to humans because we're too big to be prey, but it's not unheard of for them to bite divers, so I was kind of freaking out because even though it wasn't being aggressive, it also would not leave me alone.

After my dive I talked to some of the locals and they knew exactly which fish I was talking about.  They said that this particular barracuda was actually raised in the nearby Coral World Ocean Park and they had released it when it got too large.  So it had been around humans all its life and it just loved people, it was notorious for hanging out with scuba divers because it remembered swimming with its handlers in the park.  It was actually really sweet and kind of sad.  They had released it, but it wouldn't leave the area, it just hung around Coki Beach and was kind of a mascot."

I've got a couple. One is mine, one is a friend's.

So my friend was checking a lead in an offset sink to see if there was any going cave one afternoon. Offset sinks are physically distant from the main cave conduit, so while a primary trunk passage may have lots of clear ground water, an offset sink won't get much water circulation, so rainwater and runoff will tend to stay there for a long time. They're typically very murky and brown, clearing as you approach main cave passage. He's about 100ft in at a depth of 40 or 50ft. Nothing insane, but it's braille diving. Trying to feel his way around while running a line to see if anything goes. He comes across a wall about a foot in front of him that looks a bit unique. Often times you'll see cool patterns of mineral buildup in cave walls/floors/ceilings. So he's appreciating this cool pattern when that pattern opens its mouth and shows off its teeth and tongue. Turns out a not insignificantly sized gator lived in that sink and wasn't happy about the home invasion. He set a new speed record getting back to the surface of that particular sink. Gators aren't uncommon down there and they usually leave you alone, but not when you get that close to them in their own territory.

My story was a bit less exciting but pretty somber. I was doing a dive in the back of a fairly regularly traveled cave system, but in an area where a body had been recovered from about a mile back the week prior. That area isn't as regularly dived due to the logistics and cave passage geometry. It's not a small dive to get back there. The recovery was really challenging and there were signs of damage to the cave as we swam along where the body had been forced through restrictions, through mud, etc. But the real reality check came when we found his mask in the mud several thousand feet back. It had been dislodged (along with his nose) while the recovery divers tried to force him through a small area. It really drove home the reality of where I was and what I was doing and the respect necessary for the environment."

There was a huge expanse of open water to the side of the wreck that kind of began to slope off, and as we left the wreck we saw a huge tiger shark floating in that open water. My friends and I just swam back to our ship slowly and it didn’t really follow, but if you know anything about tiger sharks, you know how aggressive they can be, and how menacing one would look in dark water.

Seeing something like that, in that environment, with that level of darkness (it was the evening) is terrifying. The fact that it could hurt you if it wanted and you can’t do anything about it makes it 10x worse. All you can really do is keep calm and keep your distance. Remembering this around large dangerous aquatic creatures has always worked for me and I’ve never been harmed. In hindsight, it was a very beautiful moment but I def didn’t think that at the time."

So this is proper babby's first free dive material and I've since learned I'm terrified of the ocean, so this probably isn't that scary to most people. However...

I was on a boat tour that stopped off in a small bay with fucking beautiful, crystal clear, light turquoise water and nearly white sands. We'd just finished swimming with some sting rays when the tour guide offered to take some of us out for a swim in deeper water.

I was hesitant as he said the current can get quite strong and I'm not the best swimmer, but he said I could join them for as long as I felt comfortable, so I came along.

There was a small group going at a leisurely pace that I could clearly see, so I decided to do some free diving. As I said, the water was gorgeously clear. I was diving down to these little reef outcrops and checking out the fish and had barely looked ahead of me other than to check on the group.

I finished inspecting another little coral group and turned around to see where the group were and suddenly saw the sandy sea floor disappear over a knife sharp drop off. The water was so deep and inky blue with no sea floor in sight and my stomach somehow dropped into my ass and jumped into my throat at the same time.

I surfaced ASAP and got as far away from the drop off as possible and tried to pretend I never saw it."

I grew up right by Lake Superior in Michigan and was lucky enough to have an old 17’ boat with a blown head gasket. Two experiences come to mind that really freaked me out. I was out on another friends boat and we were “free diving” as we called it. Our process was to grab a couple big rocks, 50 lbs or bigger, load them up on a pontoon boat then head offshore to a drop off where the depth went down to 100’. We’d put on a life jacket, grab a big rock, and jump off then hold on as long as we could while the others on the boat watched the fish finder to see how deep we could get before letting go of the rock. It usually wasn’t even the breath holding that would get you to let go it was the frigid temperature. The driver would back up the boat after the diver jumped off so they wouldn’t rocket back up into a pontoon, the whole thing was pretty well thought out and we enjoyed it. Anyway, I once accidentally hit the clasp on the life jacket with the rock leading to the life jacket popping off while I was 80’ underwater. I was able to swim back up but I wasn’t that buoyant and that was a long long swim especially when muscles are already shocked from the cold. I ended up having to get dragged back on the boat by my buddies once I surfaced and was laying on the floor of the boat for a solid ten minutes recovering after the ordeal. That was surreal as hell and for a few seconds underwater I was thinking I might actually die, not fun.

The second incident was on my own boat, alone, again being dumb. I was fishing maybe a mile offshore, and the weather was fine most of the day. Then in the course of a few minutes a wind whipped up. It wasn’t anything major, I’d been out in much heavier weather and wasn’t overly concerned, but decided to go in. To get back in I had to go through a set of breakers, big rock walls with a gap between them that prevented waves blasting into a canal. This particular day the speed and the direction of the wind kicked up some waves that were just the right height and distance apart that I couldn’t handle them. The waves weren’t big but I was having an issue with something called broaching. I couldn’t surf the waves quite right because they were steep enough that with less power I wouldn’t have good control and with more power I’d go over the wave, hit the trough of the wave in front, and the whole boat would try to kick itself sideways and would likely capsize. I was able to keep alternating power and trimmed way the hell up so my bow wouldn’t handle them as poorly, but it was still a struggle getting in and I was seriously thinking I was gonna end up capsizing the entire time. I only had to crest maybe five or six waves to actually get through the breakers but each one I was nervous as hell for. I made it but that was the last time I ever took that boat past the breakers. 

I guess these aren’t like, creepy as in paranormal or anything like that, but they definitely freaked me the hell out….Fun times, psa parents, don’t give your kids boats/let them pull them out of other peoples yards and jerry rig them to run with spare parts from a ford tempo and gasket sealant, bad plan."

So, I learned to surf, of course. Loved it. Made friends with some of the other surfers. Everyone called me Jethro, or Cowboy. So, we're all sitting in about thirty feet of water and Mako darts under us. My tanned hide turned white as a sheet. All the kids were a little nervous, honestly.

It made a couple of circles and moved away. We all just went back to surfing. When we moved back to Oklahoma, I was telling a friend and my mother flipped the hell out like I'd almost been kidnapped by a creep from a PSA.

Really, mom? That's the story that makes you shake and shudder? Wow. I dodged feral hogs, thrown from horses, charged by bulls and mama cows, and rode around in the beds of picks ups with my grandfather bucking hay.

One of the better assignments I was put on was identifying whale sharks in the Ningaloo Reef area, not far off of the coast of Western Australia. My job was to swim next to the shark as it cruised past and take pictures, which would then be used to identify and create a record of the shark. It was really interesting how they did it, I was told they used the same program that NASA used to map the stars to ID the sharks based on their unique spot patterns. 

Whale sharks are harmless to people, and generally pretty indifferent to divers, but they're the kind of massive that's hard to appreciate until you see one up close. I think it was on my second or third dive that we were told of a particularly big shark by the spotters (about 9-10 metres, they get a lot bigger but the ones in this area are nearly all juvenile males). We jumped in and waited for it to cruise past, but this one took an unexpected turn and was swimming very quickly towards us. I kicked like crazy and managed to get out of its way, but it missed me by barely a foot.

So different people go to different places on the ship to see ahead or behind and tell the bridge if they see anything. I was in the HCO tower Aft looking over the flight deck. (Destroyer). The lighting was so intense that there were no breaks. It was like daytime. Torrential rain but the water was a smooth as glass other that the rain hitting it. It was weird. 
Also, our magnetic instruments went haywire.

I was asleep and heard about it from the bridge watch the next day.  It was logged so it happened.

I had recently moved there so it was all new to me, but I had seen them in the water with me previously. The break was pretty far out so I’m just floating peacefully alone waiting for a set of waves. I saw a large set of swells coming so I got down on my board and started paddling. Just as I’m about to pop up onto the board I take a final quick glance back to make sure all is good and a huge creature explodes out of the face of the wave right next to me. I panic and bail, scared shitless, and if felt like I did a cartoon run on top of the water how fast I got all the way in to shore. On the beach it there are people watching and talking about it as it was still out there playing in the waves. It looked like a huge dolphin but people thought it might be a pilot whale."

Around where I grew up there was an assortment of U shaped little cove things. A whole series of them UUUU that were surrounded by very tall cliffs. The only way out when the tide came in and cut you off was to sprint for it and hope you get to a U that has an exit (most dont) or just kinda wait until low tide, and hope high tide isn't that high. The cliffs mean you can't phone for help either so beyond yelling you see fucked. 

Swimming for it is a great way to get dashed against the rocks or drowned. For me once it gets to about upper thigh level you are really taking your life into your own hands wading back. 

It almost got me as a teen on many occasions. On one occasion I had to climb up the cliffs. Thank God I had rock climbing experiance. One time I did swim for it and very nearly drowned. 

Folks get caught out all the time by it. They just take the dog for a nice little walk along the beach and suddenly find themselves cut off by very strong tides pinned between that and a giant cliff. Low tide is perfectly safe. Incoming high tide is absolurely not. 

I was in one of the cave systems (not that deep really no torch needed for example) and lost track of time. By the time I got back to the entrance the waves had eroded a lot of the sand. It went from a sand walkway up to the cave to the end of the cave spitting out to a drop where I couldn't feel the bottom. Rapidly deteriorating. Cut my hands up on the rocks bouldering to the side to get around to where it was safe again. The place is a bloody death trap. 

Actually inside the water? 

On holiday I once trod on a very large stingray. Maybe 40cm across? Luckily I trod on part of it that wasn't the stinger and didn't step down hard - it simply felt my foot and split. I had no idea it was even there until i saw and felt it moving. 

When I was maybe 14, I was at the beach and ran down into the water while my mam was messing around doing something. I am standing out there chest high in the water waving and my mam just starts screaming. I didn't even notice at the time but I was basically standing in the middle of a jellyfish swarm. I know they weren't there when I got into the water. I am not *that* oblivious. The jellyfish were not harmful a bit of vinegar (I think) and the sting doesn't even hurt anymore. My mother didn't know that. I didn't get stung but she did when she charged into the water to drag me out while I was just calmly and slowly exiting. Apparently calm movements were not appropriate for the situation in her eyes. 

I did a tour of the local lifeguard place once and those folks have one hell of a dark humor. What stuck with me though; the main boat they use has a small sealed cabin. Apparently they could fit like 30 people on as rescues Inc staff. 6 of us were on (Inc staff) and it was uncomfortably snug. They then go on to say that the control cabin is sealed but most rescues would be on the deck part. If conditions caused a flip the crew would be safe, right the boat, and then buzz around picking eveyone back out of the water. To me this both makes absolute sense and also is very distressing. Imagine nearly drowning and then being punted back into the ocean along with God knows how many people. Horrifying. 

Octopus are also super smart. I saw one on a dive once, a daytime dive, just mooching around. As we approached it took off (no ink tho) towards this random rock maybe 5m away. We followed at a distance and I saw it dive into a hole in that rock and then *pick up a rock from inside the hole and use it to plug the hole from the inside*. Just **slam** no soliciting. 

Let me tell you that hysterical laughter with a regulator isn't ideal. Only one other person on the dive saw it and was also in fits. Nobody knew why both of us had suddenly gotten ourselves into apparent distress at the exact same time. You won't drown or anything but it can be a little uncomfortable and other folks will think you are in trouble esp if your mask starts to fill up as mine did. We had to end the dive a bit early because the hysterical laughter used up more oxygen than was expected. We gave a bunch of ok's but you could tell eveyone else was on edge and keeping a close eye. My mam was with me on that dive and wouldn't ever get more than about 2ft from me after it. Presumably worried I will drown. She still complains about it *'I thought you were having a seizure'*. 

The good side of the octopus incident is that folks knew exactly what to do and eveyone sprung into action. I was offered several spare regs pretty much the moment folks noticed my breathing and body position was incorrect the dive group split into 2 to deal with each of us seperatly. Someone got right up in my face and looked me in the eyes and checked all my kit to try and figure out the issue and folks prepared the inital steps to quit the dive. I gave the OK multiple times but nobody fully belived me which I kinda get. I had to bat my mam away from my float vest because she was ready to make me go up regardless of my opinion of the matter (I am an adult and was at the time but some habits I guess admittedly I would have done exactly the same to her if I thought she was going to drown). It wasn't scary for me but it was for her. She was of the opinion she was watching her eldest child about to die. For the entire rest of the dive if I so much as paused she was all over me like a rash!"

I was nervous initially when visited my first wreck as I thought I would find them foreboding and spooky (like if you stand next to a big truck or a train that’s parked!) but as soon as the wreck loomed out of the blue I was excited to go inside. 

My spookiest experience was diving a wreck off Gozo, Malta. I was down in the engine room of a 58m-long passenger ship, c40m deep at that point in the dive. It was dark, we were early in the day but some silt disturbed and vis was poor in the room. The ship is at a slight list, and as we circled the engine room and went to go back up my brain scrambled at the slightly off-level angle of the stairs as they came into view. 

I felt a pang of pure confusion and realised it was potentially the effects of disorientation mixed with gas-narcosis (40m here). 

I had to say to myself ‘hey, you know what this is, it’s fine’ followed my Buddy to the deck above and felt fine after that. 

I’m fortunate to be diving with a very experienced buddy (DM) and guide and have visited that particular wreck a number of times. It was the first time I had recognised feeling narc’ed and made me a better diver for the experience- the moment of pure brain fog was a reminder that shit can get serious very quickly at any depth. I can imagine that my short moment of disorientation mixed with challenging conditions or gear malfunction would have been a problem. 

If you want to see the stairs and wreck there’s loads of  pics online- search ‘MV Karwela’ and you’ll see!"

I'm going out on the great barrier reef tomorrow and I'm hoping one of the dives will be a SCUBA drift dive. Basically you get dropped usually directly in deep water and the current pulls you along the ocean wall you're diving against to where the boat picks you up again.

However, sometimes on drift dives, you start just in a shallow coral outcrop. You drop in where it's maybe 10m deep, then you swim towards the outer edge of the reef and....nothing. There is a literal cliff that drops off from 10m down to about 1000ft or more that fades from light blue to inky black as you look down. Because the bottom continues out due to the reef several miles out from the shore, there's no continental shelf gradual drop off. When the reef ends, there's nothing but a cliff 1000ft or more deep. You drift along this cliff and stay above 30m to see the corals, plants and wildlife that live along the edge. Because of the current, nutrients are floating by everyday constantly refreshed, so the wildlife is abundant.

When you come from the shallows and reach the cliff it is exhilarating. I don't find it terrifying, because I feel at home in the water and the ocean doesn't scare me (some of the things in it do...). I get this enormous sense of...emptiness. But not fear. If anything, loneliness. Because when you're looking out from that shelf, the next thing you would reach if you swam directly out is Peru or Chile nearly 11000 miles away...."

He had this cool diving watch, which gave you active depth readings, so while swimming i'd go subsurface and touch the ocean floor, check the depth and come back up. 10feet....20feet and then we reached this little bump, in the middle of the sea and the water was at knee level - so we had to walk across it. After walking for maybe 20 metres - it just disappeared, and there was a bottomless drop, i couldn't see the ocean floor. It was spooky but freeing of sorts, i love the ocean. We continued swimming for maybe an hour more and came back to the shore. One of my favourite memories"

Not “might”. IIRC tiger sharks always show up when the turtles lay eggs, to catch them as they leave and are too exhausted to evade them. 

Little chance of one attacking you but you do NOT want to be in the water with a shark while it’s hunting… they don’t exactly do target confirmation."

Sometimes it was even rubbing its body up against me.  If you're not familiar with them, they're kind of like giant piranhas, they're ferocious predators with similar really sharp teeth.  They're *usually* not dangerous to humans because we're too big to be prey, but it's not unheard of for them to bite divers, so I was kind of freaking out because even though it wasn't being aggressive, it also would not leave me alone.

After my dive I talked to some of the locals and they knew exactly which fish I was talking about.  They said that this particular barracuda was actually raised in the nearby Coral World Ocean Park and they had released it when it got too large.  So it had been around humans all its life and it just loved people, it was notorious for hanging out with scuba divers because it remembered swimming with its handlers in the park.  It was actually really sweet and kind of sad.  They had released it, but it wouldn't leave the area, it just hung around Coki Beach and was kind of a mascot."

I've got a couple. One is mine, one is a friend's.

So my friend was checking a lead in an offset sink to see if there was any going cave one afternoon. Offset sinks are physically distant from the main cave conduit, so while a primary trunk passage may have lots of clear ground water, an offset sink won't get much water circulation, so rainwater and runoff will tend to stay there for a long time. They're typically very murky and brown, clearing as you approach main cave passage. He's about 100ft in at a depth of 40 or 50ft. Nothing insane, but it's braille diving. Trying to feel his way around while running a line to see if anything goes. He comes across a wall about a foot in front of him that looks a bit unique. Often times you'll see cool patterns of mineral buildup in cave walls/floors/ceilings. So he's appreciating this cool pattern when that pattern opens its mouth and shows off its teeth and tongue. Turns out a not insignificantly sized gator lived in that sink and wasn't happy about the home invasion. He set a new speed record getting back to the surface of that particular sink. Gators aren't uncommon down there and they usually leave you alone, but not when you get that close to them in their own territory.

My story was a bit less exciting but pretty somber. I was doing a dive in the back of a fairly regularly traveled cave system, but in an area where a body had been recovered from about a mile back the week prior. That area isn't as regularly dived due to the logistics and cave passage geometry. It's not a small dive to get back there. The recovery was really challenging and there were signs of damage to the cave as we swam along where the body had been forced through restrictions, through mud, etc. But the real reality check came when we found his mask in the mud several thousand feet back. It had been dislodged (along with his nose) while the recovery divers tried to force him through a small area. It really drove home the reality of where I was and what I was doing and the respect necessary for the environment."

My friends and I just swam back to our ship slowly and it didn’t really follow, but if you know anything about tiger sharks, you know how aggressive they can be, and how menacing one would look in dark water.

Seeing something like that, in that environment, with that level of darkness (it was the evening) is terrifying. The fact that it could hurt you if it wanted and you can’t do anything about it makes it 10x worse. All you can really do is keep calm and keep your distance.

So this is proper babby's first free dive material and I've since learned I'm terrified of the ocean, so this probably isn't that scary to most people. However...

I was on a boat tour that stopped off in a small bay with fucking beautiful, crystal clear, light turquoise water and nearly white sands. We'd just finished swimming with some sting rays when the tour guide offered to take some of us out for a swim in deeper water.

I was hesitant as he said the current can get quite strong and I'm not the best swimmer, but he said I could join them for as long as I felt comfortable, so I came along.

There was a small group going at a leisurely pace that I could clearly see, so I decided to do some free diving. As I said, the water was gorgeously clear. I was diving down to these little reef outcrops and checking out the fish and had barely looked ahead of me other than to check on the group.

I finished inspecting another little coral group and turned around to see where the group were and suddenly saw the sandy sea floor disappear over a knife sharp drop off. The water was so deep and inky blue with no sea floor in sight and my stomach somehow dropped into my ass and jumped into my throat at the same time.

I surfaced ASAP and got as far away from the drop off as possible and tried to pretend I never saw it."

I grew up right by Lake Superior in Michigan and was lucky enough to have an old 17’ boat with a blown head gasket. Two experiences come to mind that really freaked me out. I was out on another friends boat and we were “free diving” as we called it. Our process was to grab a couple big rocks, 50 lbs or bigger, load them up on a pontoon boat then head offshore to a drop off where the depth went down to 100’. We’d put on a life jacket, grab a big rock, and jump off then hold on as long as we could while the others on the boat watched the fish finder to see how deep we could get before letting go of the rock. It usually wasn’t even the breath holding that would get you to let go it was the frigid temperature. The driver would back up the boat after the diver jumped off so they wouldn’t rocket back up into a pontoon, the whole thing was pretty well thought out and we enjoyed it. Anyway, I once accidentally hit the clasp on the life jacket with the rock leading to the life jacket popping off while I was 80’ underwater. I was able to swim back up but I wasn’t that buoyant and that was a long long swim especially when muscles are already shocked from the cold. I ended up having to get dragged back on the boat by my buddies once I surfaced and was laying on the floor of the boat for a solid ten minutes recovering after the ordeal. That was surreal as hell and for a few seconds underwater I was thinking I might actually die, not fun.

The second incident was on my own boat, alone, again being dumb. I was fishing maybe a mile offshore, and the weather was fine most of the day. Then in the course of a few minutes a wind whipped up. It wasn’t anything major, I’d been out in much heavier weather and wasn’t overly concerned, but decided to go in. To get back in I had to go through a set of breakers, big rock walls with a gap between them that prevented waves blasting into a canal. This particular day the speed and the direction of the wind kicked up some waves that were just the right height and distance apart that I couldn’t handle them. The waves weren’t big but I was having an issue with something called broaching. I couldn’t surf the waves quite right because they were steep enough that with less power I wouldn’t have good control and with more power I’d go over the wave, hit the trough of the wave in front, and the whole boat would try to kick itself sideways and would likely capsize. I was able to keep alternating power and trimmed way the hell up so my bow wouldn’t handle them as poorly, but it was still a struggle getting in and I was seriously thinking I was gonna end up capsizing the entire time. I only had to crest maybe five or six waves to actually get through the breakers but each one I was nervous as hell for. I made it but that was the last time I ever took that boat past the breakers. 

I guess these aren’t like, creepy as in paranormal or anything like that, but they definitely freaked me the hell out….Fun times, psa parents, don’t give your kids boats/let them pull them out of other peoples yards and jerry rig them to run with spare parts from a ford tempo and gasket sealant, bad plan."

It was really interesting how they did it, I was told they used the same program that NASA used to map the stars to ID the sharks based on their unique spot patterns. 

Whale sharks are harmless to people, and generally pretty indifferent to divers, but they're the kind of massive that's hard to appreciate until you see one up close. I think it was on my second or third dive that we were told of a particularly big shark by the spotters (about 9-10 metres, they get a lot bigger but the ones in this area are nearly all juvenile males). We jumped in and waited for it to cruise past, but this one took an unexpected turn and was swimming very quickly towards us.

Performed it faster and better then on the surface in the comfort of air-conditioned classroom. My instructor was happy and we carried on with the slow ascend. Little did i know that i was completely narced and confused the button that blows the BCD up with the one that dumps the air. Basically i was sinking vertically without even understanding my mistake. That’s when the instructor came to my resque and everything ended up well. Best part of the whole experience - it was all on film and the people in the dive center saw it and kind of congratulated me on being alive. When i saw the video i was amazed at how happily stupid i looked. Smiling and kicking my fins thinking i am going up while actually descending deeper. That was a good lesson for me not to underestimate the nitrogen narcosis and the effects it has on the mind."

I decided to paddle around the pier, going from the north side to the south side. When I reached the last pylon, a HUGE fin popped up about 5 feet in front of me. I knew instantly it was a massive white shark (12-15ft based on the size of the fin)- I’ve been surfing my whole life, I’ve been in the water with dolphins many times. This was 100% not a dolphin.

This fin was more triangular with a serrated back side (almost like a steak knife) with a sandpaper looking texture. Dolphins have more scoop in their fin and very smooth texture on their skin.

The way it swam gave me instant chills- fishy, more side to side and straight than the classic up and down, coming up for breath dolphin. 

I froze. Trying to control my panic, waited for it to disappear and as smoothly as possible, turned my board around, paddled through the pier back to land.

It was absolutely checking me out but didn’t show any interest towards me. Since then, I’m not that afraid of sharks but I still get the chills thinking about that day."

We were supposed to only dive down to a depth of 25 meters and check out these flashlight fish that would school together in a cargo hold, they had these really bright green eyes that looked amazing and lit up underwater. I still don’t really know what happened that night but it felt like we were staring at these fish for forever. Suddenly I didn’t feel right, my breathing felt funny, I tried to grab my gauge to check how much air I had left, it took every bit of muscle I had to reach for my gauge connected to my waist, I slowly grabbed it and read that I had about half a tank left, relived for a split second but still concerned something was wrong I reached for my mum to signal her something wasn’t right, I grabbed her arm but couldn’t hold on, I just started sinking to the bottom. My mum quickly grabbed my arm as I fell but I had no leg movement, so I started dragging her to the bottom with me, my dad now realises somethings wrong and grabs my mum trying to pull us all up. The dive guide now is freaking out and trying to make sure everyone is alright, they all start swimming me back up and in to shore. Once we got up closer, I started to feel normal again but abit dazed and confused. Turns out I had nitrogen narcosis, and had dropped to 40 meters when I couldn’t swim anymore. For those of you who don’t know what nitrogen narcosis is, it’s when you have to much nitrogen in your body and it gives you a intoxicated effect.

Around where I grew up there was an assortment of U shaped little cove things. A whole series of them UUUU that were surrounded by very tall cliffs. The only way out when the tide came in and cut you off was to sprint for it and hope you get to a U that has an exit (most dont) or just kinda wait until low tide, and hope high tide isn't that high. The cliffs mean you can't phone for help either so beyond yelling you see fucked. 

Swimming for it is a great way to get dashed against the rocks or drowned. For me once it gets to about upper thigh level you are really taking your life into your own hands wading back. 

It almost got me as a teen on many occasions. On one occasion I had to climb up the cliffs. Thank God I had rock climbing experiance. One time I did swim for it and very nearly drowned. 

Folks get caught out all the time by it. They just take the dog for a nice little walk along the beach and suddenly find themselves cut off by very strong tides pinned between that and a giant cliff. Low tide is perfectly safe. Incoming high tide is absolurely not. 

I was in one of the cave systems (not that deep really no torch needed for example) and lost track of time. By the time I got back to the entrance the waves had eroded a lot of the sand. It went from a sand walkway up to the cave to the end of the cave spitting out to a drop where I couldn't feel the bottom. Rapidly deteriorating. Cut my hands up on the rocks bouldering to the side to get around to where it was safe again. The place is a bloody death trap. 

Actually inside the water? 

On holiday I once trod on a very large stingray. Maybe 40cm across? Luckily I trod on part of it that wasn't the stinger and didn't step down hard - it simply felt my foot and split. I had no idea it was even there until i saw and felt it moving. 

When I was maybe 14, I was at the beach and ran down into the water while my mam was messing around doing something. I am standing out there chest high in the water waving and my mam just starts screaming. I didn't even notice at the time but I was basically standing in the middle of a jellyfish swarm. I know they weren't there when I got into the water. I am not *that* oblivious. The jellyfish were not harmful a bit of vinegar (I think) and the sting doesn't even hurt anymore. My mother didn't know that. I didn't get stung but she did when she charged into the water to drag me out while I was just calmly and slowly exiting. Apparently calm movements were not appropriate for the situation in her eyes. 

I did a tour of the local lifeguard place once and those folks have one hell of a dark humor. What stuck with me though; the main boat they use has a small sealed cabin. Apparently they could fit like 30 people on as rescues Inc staff. 6 of us were on (Inc staff) and it was uncomfortably snug. They then go on to say that the control cabin is sealed but most rescues would be on the deck part. If conditions caused a flip the crew would be safe, right the boat, and then buzz around picking eveyone back out of the water. To me this both makes absolute sense and also is very distressing. Imagine nearly drowning and then being punted back into the ocean along with God knows how many people. Horrifying. 

Octopus are also super smart. I saw one on a dive once, a daytime dive, just mooching around. As we approached it took off (no ink tho) towards this random rock maybe 5m away. We followed at a distance and I saw it dive into a hole in that rock and then *pick up a rock from inside the hole and use it to plug the hole from the inside*. Just **slam** no soliciting. 

Let me tell you that hysterical laughter with a regulator isn't ideal. Only one other person on the dive saw it and was also in fits. Nobody knew why both of us had suddenly gotten ourselves into apparent distress at the exact same time. You won't drown or anything but it can be a little uncomfortable and other folks will think you are in trouble esp if your mask starts to fill up as mine did. We had to end the dive a bit early because the hysterical laughter used up more oxygen than was expected. We gave a bunch of ok's but you could tell eveyone else was on edge and keeping a close eye. My mam was with me on that dive and wouldn't ever get more than about 2ft from me after it. Presumably worried I will drown. She still complains about it *'I thought you were having a seizure'*. 

The good side of the octopus incident is that folks knew exactly what to do and eveyone sprung into action. I was offered several spare regs pretty much the moment folks noticed my breathing and body position was incorrect the dive group split into 2 to deal with each of us seperatly. Someone got right up in my face and looked me in the eyes and checked all my kit to try and figure out the issue and folks prepared the inital steps to quit the dive. I gave the OK multiple times but nobody fully belived me which I kinda get. I had to bat my mam away from my float vest because she was ready to make me go up regardless of my opinion of the matter (I am an adult and was at the time but some habits I guess admittedly I would have done exactly the same to her if I thought she was going to drown). It wasn't scary for me but it was for her. She was of the opinion she was watching her eldest child about to die. For the entire rest of the dive if I so much as paused she was all over me like a rash!"

I was nervous initially when visited my first wreck as I thought I would find them foreboding and spooky (like if you stand next to a big truck or a train that’s parked!) but as soon as the wreck loomed out of the blue I was excited to go inside. 

My spookiest experience was diving a wreck off Gozo, Malta. I was down in the engine room of a 58m-long passenger ship, c40m deep at that point in the dive. It was dark, we were early in the day but some silt disturbed and vis was poor in the room. The ship is at a slight list, and as we circled the engine room and went to go back up my brain scrambled at the slightly off-level angle of the stairs as they came into view. 

I felt a pang of pure confusion and realised it was potentially the effects of disorientation mixed with gas-narcosis (40m here). 

I had to say to myself ‘hey, you know what this is, it’s fine’ followed my Buddy to the deck above and felt fine after that. 

I’m fortunate to be diving with a very experienced buddy (DM) and guide and have visited that particular wreck a number of times. It was the first time I had recognised feeling narc’ed and made me a better diver for the experience- the moment of pure brain fog was a reminder that shit can get serious very quickly at any depth. I can imagine that my short moment of disorientation mixed with challenging conditions or gear malfunction would have been a problem. 

If you want to see the stairs and wreck there’s loads of  pics online- search ‘MV Karwela’ and you’ll see!"

I'm going out on the great barrier reef tomorrow and I'm hoping one of the dives will be a SCUBA drift dive. Basically you get dropped usually directly in deep water and the current pulls you along the ocean wall you're diving against to where the boat picks you up again.

However, sometimes on drift dives, you start just in a shallow coral outcrop. You drop in where it's maybe 10m deep, then you swim towards the outer edge of the reef and....nothing. There is a literal cliff that drops off from 10m down to about 1000ft or more that fades from light blue to inky black as you look down. Because the bottom continues out due to the reef several miles out from the shore, there's no continental shelf gradual drop off. When the reef ends, there's nothing but a cliff 1000ft or more deep. You drift along this cliff and stay above 30m to see the corals, plants and wildlife that live along the edge. Because of the current, nutrients are floating by everyday constantly refreshed, so the wildlife is abundant.

When you come from the shallows and reach the cliff it is exhilarating. I don't find it terrifying, because I feel at home in the water and the ocean doesn't scare me (some of the things in it do...). I get this enormous sense of...emptiness. But not fear. If anything, loneliness. Because when you're looking out from that shelf, the next thing you would reach if you swam directly out is Peru or Chile nearly 11000 miles away...."

He had this cool diving watch, which gave you active depth readings, so while swimming i'd go subsurface and touch the ocean floor, check the depth and come back up. 10feet....20feet and then we reached this little bump, in the middle of the sea and the water was at knee level - so we had to walk across it. After walking for maybe 20 metres - it just disappeared, and there was a bottomless drop, i couldn't see the ocean floor. It was spooky but freeing of sorts, i love the ocean. We continued swimming for maybe an hour more and came back to the shore. One of my favourite memories"

Sometimes it was even rubbing its body up against me.  If you're not familiar with them, they're kind of like giant piranhas, they're ferocious predators with similar really sharp teeth.  They're *usually* not dangerous to humans because we're too big to be prey, but it's not unheard of for them to bite divers, so I was kind of freaking out because even though it wasn't being aggressive, it also would not leave me alone.

After my dive I talked to some of the locals and they knew exactly which fish I was talking about.  They said that this particular barracuda was actually raised in the nearby Coral World Ocean Park and they had released it when it got too large.  So it had been around humans all its life and it just loved people, it was notorious for hanging out with scuba divers because it remembered swimming with its handlers in the park.  It was actually really sweet and kind of sad.  They had released it, but it wouldn't leave the area, it just hung around Coki Beach and was kind of a mascot."

I've got a couple. One is mine, one is a friend's.

So my friend was checking a lead in an offset sink to see if there was any going cave one afternoon. Offset sinks are physically distant from the main cave conduit, so while a primary trunk passage may have lots of clear ground water, an offset sink won't get much water circulation, so rainwater and runoff will tend to stay there for a long time. They're typically very murky and brown, clearing as you approach main cave passage. He's about 100ft in at a depth of 40 or 50ft. Nothing insane, but it's braille diving. Trying to feel his way around while running a line to see if anything goes. He comes across a wall about a foot in front of him that looks a bit unique. Often times you'll see cool patterns of mineral buildup in cave walls/floors/ceilings. So he's appreciating this cool pattern when that pattern opens its mouth and shows off its teeth and tongue. Turns out a not insignificantly sized gator lived in that sink and wasn't happy about the home invasion. He set a new speed record getting back to the surface of that particular sink. Gators aren't uncommon down there and they usually leave you alone, but not when you get that close to them in their own territory.

My story was a bit less exciting but pretty somber. I was doing a dive in the back of a fairly regularly traveled cave system, but in an area where a body had been recovered from about a mile back the week prior. That area isn't as regularly dived due to the logistics and cave passage geometry. It's not a small dive to get back there. The recovery was really challenging and there were signs of damage to the cave as we swam along where the body had been forced through restrictions, through mud, etc. But the real reality check came when we found his mask in the mud several thousand feet back. It had been dislodged (along with his nose) while the recovery divers tried to force him through a small area. It really drove home the reality of where I was and what I was doing and the respect necessary for the environment."

Seeing something like that, in that environment, with that level of darkness (it was the evening) is terrifying. The fact that it could hurt you if it wanted and you can’t do anything about it makes it 10x worse. All you can really do is keep calm and keep your distance.

So this is proper babby's first free dive material and I've since learned I'm terrified of the ocean, so this probably isn't that scary to most people. However...

I was on a boat tour that stopped off in a small bay with fucking beautiful, crystal clear, light turquoise water and nearly white sands. We'd just finished swimming with some sting rays when the tour guide offered to take some of us out for a swim in deeper water.

I was hesitant as he said the current can get quite strong and I'm not the best swimmer, but he said I could join them for as long as I felt comfortable, so I came along.

There was a small group going at a leisurely pace that I could clearly see, so I decided to do some free diving. As I said, the water was gorgeously clear. I was diving down to these little reef outcrops and checking out the fish and had barely looked ahead of me other than to check on the group.

I finished inspecting another little coral group and turned around to see where the group were and suddenly saw the sandy sea floor disappear over a knife sharp drop off. The water was so deep and inky blue with no sea floor in sight and my stomach somehow dropped into my ass and jumped into my throat at the same time.

I surfaced ASAP and got as far away from the drop off as possible and tried to pretend I never saw it."

I grew up right by Lake Superior in Michigan and was lucky enough to have an old 17’ boat with a blown head gasket. Two experiences come to mind that really freaked me out. I was out on another friends boat and we were “free diving” as we called it. Our process was to grab a couple big rocks, 50 lbs or bigger, load them up on a pontoon boat then head offshore to a drop off where the depth went down to 100’. We’d put on a life jacket, grab a big rock, and jump off then hold on as long as we could while the others on the boat watched the fish finder to see how deep we could get before letting go of the rock. It usually wasn’t even the breath holding that would get you to let go it was the frigid temperature. The driver would back up the boat after the diver jumped off so they wouldn’t rocket back up into a pontoon, the whole thing was pretty well thought out and we enjoyed it. Anyway, I once accidentally hit the clasp on the life jacket with the rock leading to the life jacket popping off while I was 80’ underwater. I was able to swim back up but I wasn’t that buoyant and that was a long long swim especially when muscles are already shocked from the cold. I ended up having to get dragged back on the boat by my buddies once I surfaced and was laying on the floor of the boat for a solid ten minutes recovering after the ordeal. That was surreal as hell and for a few seconds underwater I was thinking I might actually die, not fun.

The second incident was on my own boat, alone, again being dumb. I was fishing maybe a mile offshore, and the weather was fine most of the day. Then in the course of a few minutes a wind whipped up. It wasn’t anything major, I’d been out in much heavier weather and wasn’t overly concerned, but decided to go in. To get back in I had to go through a set of breakers, big rock walls with a gap between them that prevented waves blasting into a canal. This particular day the speed and the direction of the wind kicked up some waves that were just the right height and distance apart that I couldn’t handle them. The waves weren’t big but I was having an issue with something called broaching. I couldn’t surf the waves quite right because they were steep enough that with less power I wouldn’t have good control and with more power I’d go over the wave, hit the trough of the wave in front, and the whole boat would try to kick itself sideways and would likely capsize. I was able to keep alternating power and trimmed way the hell up so my bow wouldn’t handle them as poorly, but it was still a struggle getting in and I was seriously thinking I was gonna end up capsizing the entire time. I only had to crest maybe five or six waves to actually get through the breakers but each one I was nervous as hell for. I made it but that was the last time I ever took that boat past the breakers. 

I guess these aren’t like, creepy as in paranormal or anything like that, but they definitely freaked me the hell out….Fun times, psa parents, don’t give your kids boats/let them pull them out of other peoples yards and jerry rig them to run with spare parts from a ford tempo and gasket sealant, bad plan."

One of the better assignments I was put on was identifying whale sharks in the Ningaloo Reef area, not far off of the coast of Western Australia. My job was to swim next to the shark as it cruised past and take pictures, which would then be used to identify and create a record of the shark. It was really interesting how they did it, I was told they used the same program that NASA used to map the stars to ID the sharks based on their unique spot patterns. 

Whale sharks are harmless to people, and generally pretty indifferent to divers, but they're the kind of massive that's hard to appreciate until you see one up close. I think it was on my second or third dive that we were told of a particularly big shark by the spotters (about 9-10 metres, they get a lot bigger but the ones in this area are nearly all juvenile males). We jumped in and waited for it to cruise past, but this one took an unexpected turn and was swimming very quickly towards us. I kicked like crazy and managed to get out of its way, but it missed me by barely a foot. 

I was never in any real danger, worst case it would have just bumped me out of the way, but seeing a fish with a head the size of an SUV hurtling toward you underwater is something else."

This fin was more triangular with a serrated back side (almost like a steak knife) with a sandpaper looking texture. Dolphins have more scoop in their fin and very smooth texture on their skin.

The way it swam gave me instant chills- fishy, more side to side and straight than the classic up and down, coming up for breath dolphin. 

I froze. Trying to control my panic, waited for it to disappear and as smoothly as possible, turned my board around, paddled through the pier back to land.

I was 14 at the time and my parents were life long divers, we dived the Coolidge twice that day already and our guide offered a night dive to us. 
We were supposed to only dive down to a depth of 25 meters and check out these flashlight fish that would school together in a cargo hold, they had these really bright green eyes that looked amazing and lit up underwater. I still don’t really know what happened that night but it felt like we were staring at these fish for forever. Suddenly I didn’t feel right, my breathing felt funny, I tried to grab my gauge to check how much air I had left, it took every bit of muscle I had to reach for my gauge connected to my waist, I slowly grabbed it and read that I had about half a tank left, relived for a split second but still concerned something was wrong I reached for my mum to signal her something wasn’t right, I grabbed her arm but couldn’t hold on, I just started sinking to the bottom. My mum quickly grabbed my arm as I fell but I had no leg movement, so I started dragging her to the bottom with me, my dad now realises somethings wrong and grabs my mum trying to pull us all up. The dive guide now is freaking out and trying to make sure everyone is alright, they all start swimming me back up and in to shore. Once we got up closer, I started to feel normal again but abit dazed and confused. Turns out I had nitrogen narcosis, and had dropped to 40 meters when I couldn’t swim anymore. For those of you who don’t know what nitrogen narcosis is, it’s when you have to much nitrogen in your body and it gives you a intoxicated effect. 
Nothing to hectic but still a vivid memory of thinking I was gonna sink to the bottom of the ocean not being able to do anything about it."

I was in the Gulf of Tehuantepec (western Mexico) about 60nm offshore in a 31ft cutter. It was DARK, right before one of the worst storms I’ve ever encountered, at probably 1 or 2 in the morning, and off of my port quarter I heard the faintest sound of a small outboard engine. Like a small panga engine. No running lights or anything. I heard it for about thirty seconds before the sound of the approaching thunder overtook it.

I panic and bail, scared shitless, and if felt like I did a cartoon run on top of the water how fast I got all the way in to shore.

Around where I grew up there was an assortment of U shaped little cove things. A whole series of them UUUU that were surrounded by very tall cliffs. The only way out when the tide came in and cut you off was to sprint for it and hope you get to a U that has an exit (most dont) or just kinda wait until low tide, and hope high tide isn't that high. The cliffs mean you can't phone for help either so beyond yelling you see fucked. 

Swimming for it is a great way to get dashed against the rocks or drowned. For me once it gets to about upper thigh level you are really taking your life into your own hands wading back. 

It almost got me as a teen on many occasions. On one occasion I had to climb up the cliffs. Thank God I had rock climbing experiance. One time I did swim for it and very nearly drowned. 

Folks get caught out all the time by it. They just take the dog for a nice little walk along the beach and suddenly find themselves cut off by very strong tides pinned between that and a giant cliff. Low tide is perfectly safe. Incoming high tide is absolurely not. 

I was in one of the cave systems (not that deep really no torch needed for example) and lost track of time. By the time I got back to the entrance the waves had eroded a lot of the sand. It went from a sand walkway up to the cave to the end of the cave spitting out to a drop where I couldn't feel the bottom. Rapidly deteriorating. Cut my hands up on the rocks bouldering to the side to get around to where it was safe again. The place is a bloody death trap. 

Actually inside the water? 

On holiday I once trod on a very large stingray. Maybe 40cm across? Luckily I trod on part of it that wasn't the stinger and didn't step down hard - it simply felt my foot and split. I had no idea it was even there until i saw and felt it moving. 

When I was maybe 14, I was at the beach and ran down into the water while my mam was messing around doing something. I am standing out there chest high in the water waving and my mam just starts screaming. I didn't even notice at the time but I was basically standing in the middle of a jellyfish swarm. I know they weren't there when I got into the water. I am not *that* oblivious. The jellyfish were not harmful a bit of vinegar (I think) and the sting doesn't even hurt anymore. My mother didn't know that. I didn't get stung but she did when she charged into the water to drag me out while I was just calmly and slowly exiting. Apparently calm movements were not appropriate for the situation in her eyes. 

I did a tour of the local lifeguard place once and those folks have one hell of a dark humor. What stuck with me though; the main boat they use has a small sealed cabin. Apparently they could fit like 30 people on as rescues Inc staff. 6 of us were on (Inc staff) and it was uncomfortably snug. They then go on to say that the control cabin is sealed but most rescues would be on the deck part. If conditions caused a flip the crew would be safe, right the boat, and then buzz around picking eveyone back out of the water. To me this both makes absolute sense and also is very distressing. Imagine nearly drowning and then being punted back into the ocean along with God knows how many people. Horrifying. 

Octopus are also super smart. I saw one on a dive once, a daytime dive, just mooching around. As we approached it took off (no ink tho) towards this random rock maybe 5m away. We followed at a distance and I saw it dive into a hole in that rock and then *pick up a rock from inside the hole and use it to plug the hole from the inside*. Just **slam** no soliciting. 

Let me tell you that hysterical laughter with a regulator isn't ideal. Only one other person on the dive saw it and was also in fits. Nobody knew why both of us had suddenly gotten ourselves into apparent distress at the exact same time. You won't drown or anything but it can be a little uncomfortable and other folks will think you are in trouble esp if your mask starts to fill up as mine did. We had to end the dive a bit early because the hysterical laughter used up more oxygen than was expected. We gave a bunch of ok's but you could tell eveyone else was on edge and keeping a close eye. My mam was with me on that dive and wouldn't ever get more than about 2ft from me after it. Presumably worried I will drown. She still complains about it *'I thought you were having a seizure'*. 

The good side of the octopus incident is that folks knew exactly what to do and eveyone sprung into action. I was offered several spare regs pretty much the moment folks noticed my breathing and body position was incorrect the dive group split into 2 to deal with each of us seperatly. Someone got right up in my face and looked me in the eyes and checked all my kit to try and figure out the issue and folks prepared the inital steps to quit the dive. I gave the OK multiple times but nobody fully belived me which I kinda get. I had to bat my mam away from my float vest because she was ready to make me go up regardless of my opinion of the matter (I am an adult and was at the time but some habits I guess admittedly I would have done exactly the same to her if I thought she was going to drown). It wasn't scary for me but it was for her. She was of the opinion she was watching her eldest child about to die. For the entire rest of the dive if I so much as paused she was all over me like a rash!"

I was nervous initially when visited my first wreck as I thought I would find them foreboding and spooky (like if you stand next to a big truck or a train that’s parked!) but as soon as the wreck loomed out of the blue I was excited to go inside. 

My spookiest experience was diving a wreck off Gozo, Malta. I was down in the engine room of a 58m-long passenger ship, c40m deep at that point in the dive. It was dark, we were early in the day but some silt disturbed and vis was poor in the room. The ship is at a slight list, and as we circled the engine room and went to go back up my brain scrambled at the slightly off-level angle of the stairs as they came into view. 

I felt a pang of pure confusion and realised it was potentially the effects of disorientation mixed with gas-narcosis (40m here). 

I had to say to myself ‘hey, you know what this is, it’s fine’ followed my Buddy to the deck above and felt fine after that. 

I’m fortunate to be diving with a very experienced buddy (DM) and guide and have visited that particular wreck a number of times. It was the first time I had recognised feeling narc’ed and made me a better diver for the experience- the moment of pure brain fog was a reminder that shit can get serious very quickly at any depth. I can imagine that my short moment of disorientation mixed with challenging conditions or gear malfunction would have been a problem. 

If you want to see the stairs and wreck there’s loads of  pics online- search ‘MV Karwela’ and you’ll see!"

I'm going out on the great barrier reef tomorrow and I'm hoping one of the dives will be a SCUBA drift dive. Basically you get dropped usually directly in deep water and the current pulls you along the ocean wall you're diving against to where the boat picks you up again.

However, sometimes on drift dives, you start just in a shallow coral outcrop. You drop in where it's maybe 10m deep, then you swim towards the outer edge of the reef and....nothing. There is a literal cliff that drops off from 10m down to about 1000ft or more that fades from light blue to inky black as you look down. Because the bottom continues out due to the reef several miles out from the shore, there's no continental shelf gradual drop off. When the reef ends, there's nothing but a cliff 1000ft or more deep. You drift along this cliff and stay above 30m to see the corals, plants and wildlife that live along the edge. Because of the current, nutrients are floating by everyday constantly refreshed, so the wildlife is abundant.

When you come from the shallows and reach the cliff it is exhilarating. I don't find it terrifying, because I feel at home in the water and the ocean doesn't scare me (some of the things in it do...). I get this enormous sense of...emptiness. But not fear. If anything, loneliness. Because when you're looking out from that shelf, the next thing you would reach if you swam directly out is Peru or Chile nearly 11000 miles away...."

He had this cool diving watch, which gave you active depth readings, so while swimming i'd go subsurface and touch the ocean floor, check the depth and come back up. 10feet....20feet and then we reached this little bump, in the middle of the sea and the water was at knee level - so we had to walk across it. After walking for maybe 20 metres - it just disappeared, and there was a bottomless drop, i couldn't see the ocean floor. It was spooky but freeing of sorts, i love the ocean. We continued swimming for maybe an hour more and came back to the shore. One of my favourite memories"

Sometimes it was even rubbing its body up against me.  If you're not familiar with them, they're kind of like giant piranhas, they're ferocious predators with similar really sharp teeth.  They're *usually* not dangerous to humans because we're too big to be prey, but it's not unheard of for them to bite divers, so I was kind of freaking out because even though it wasn't being aggressive, it also would not leave me alone.

After my dive I talked to some of the locals and they knew exactly which fish I was talking about.  They said that this particular barracuda was actually raised in the nearby Coral World Ocean Park and they had released it when it got too large.  So it had been around humans all its life and it just loved people, it was notorious for hanging out with scuba divers because it remembered swimming with its handlers in the park.  It was actually really sweet and kind of sad.  They had released it, but it wouldn't leave the area, it just hung around Coki Beach and was kind of a mascot."

I've got a couple. One is mine, one is a friend's.

So my friend was checking a lead in an offset sink to see if there was any going cave one afternoon. Offset sinks are physically distant from the main cave conduit, so while a primary trunk passage may have lots of clear ground water, an offset sink won't get much water circulation, so rainwater and runoff will tend to stay there for a long time. They're typically very murky and brown, clearing as you approach main cave passage. He's about 100ft in at a depth of 40 or 50ft. Nothing insane, but it's braille diving. Trying to feel his way around while running a line to see if anything goes. He comes across a wall about a foot in front of him that looks a bit unique. Often times you'll see cool patterns of mineral buildup in cave walls/floors/ceilings. So he's appreciating this cool pattern when that pattern opens its mouth and shows off its teeth and tongue. Turns out a not insignificantly sized gator lived in that sink and wasn't happy about the home invasion. He set a new speed record getting back to the surface of that particular sink. Gators aren't uncommon down there and they usually leave you alone, but not when you get that close to them in their own territory.

My story was a bit less exciting but pretty somber. I was doing a dive in the back of a fairly regularly traveled cave system, but in an area where a body had been recovered from about a mile back the week prior. That area isn't as regularly dived due to the logistics and cave passage geometry. It's not a small dive to get back there. The recovery was really challenging and there were signs of damage to the cave as we swam along where the body had been forced through restrictions, through mud, etc. But the real reality check came when we found his mask in the mud several thousand feet back. It had been dislodged (along with his nose) while the recovery divers tried to force him through a small area. It really drove home the reality of where I was and what I was doing and the respect necessary for the environment."

There was a huge expanse of open water to the side of the wreck that kind of began to slope off, and as we left the wreck we saw a huge tiger shark floating in that open water. My friends and I just swam back to our ship slowly and it didn’t really follow, but if you know anything about tiger sharks, you know how aggressive they can be, and how menacing one would look in dark water.

Seeing something like that, in that environment, with that level of darkness (it was the evening) is terrifying. The fact that it could hurt you if it wanted and you can’t do anything about it makes it 10x worse. All you can really do is keep calm and keep your distance. Remembering this around large dangerous aquatic creatures has always worked for me and I’ve never been harmed. In hindsight, it was a very beautiful moment but I def didn’t think that at the time."

So this is proper babby's first free dive material and I've since learned I'm terrified of the ocean, so this probably isn't that scary to most people. However...

I was on a boat tour that stopped off in a small bay with fucking beautiful, crystal clear, light turquoise water and nearly white sands. We'd just finished swimming with some sting rays when the tour guide offered to take some of us out for a swim in deeper water.

I was hesitant as he said the current can get quite strong and I'm not the best swimmer, but he said I could join them for as long as I felt comfortable, so I came along.

There was a small group going at a leisurely pace that I could clearly see, so I decided to do some free diving. As I said, the water was gorgeously clear. I was diving down to these little reef outcrops and checking out the fish and had barely looked ahead of me other than to check on the group.

I finished inspecting another little coral group and turned around to see where the group were and suddenly saw the sandy sea floor disappear over a knife sharp drop off. The water was so deep and inky blue with no sea floor in sight and my stomach somehow dropped into my ass and jumped into my throat at the same time.

I surfaced ASAP and got as far away from the drop off as possible and tried to pretend I never saw it."

I grew up right by Lake Superior in Michigan and was lucky enough to have an old 17’ boat with a blown head gasket. Two experiences come to mind that really freaked me out. I was out on another friends boat and we were “free diving” as we called it. Our process was to grab a couple big rocks, 50 lbs or bigger, load them up on a pontoon boat then head offshore to a drop off where the depth went down to 100’. We’d put on a life jacket, grab a big rock, and jump off then hold on as long as we could while the others on the boat watched the fish finder to see how deep we could get before letting go of the rock. It usually wasn’t even the breath holding that would get you to let go it was the frigid temperature. The driver would back up the boat after the diver jumped off so they wouldn’t rocket back up into a pontoon, the whole thing was pretty well thought out and we enjoyed it. Anyway, I once accidentally hit the clasp on the life jacket with the rock leading to the life jacket popping off while I was 80’ underwater. I was able to swim back up but I wasn’t that buoyant and that was a long long swim especially when muscles are already shocked from the cold. I ended up having to get dragged back on the boat by my buddies once I surfaced and was laying on the floor of the boat for a solid ten minutes recovering after the ordeal. That was surreal as hell and for a few seconds underwater I was thinking I might actually die, not fun.

The second incident was on my own boat, alone, again being dumb. I was fishing maybe a mile offshore, and the weather was fine most of the day. Then in the course of a few minutes a wind whipped up. It wasn’t anything major, I’d been out in much heavier weather and wasn’t overly concerned, but decided to go in. To get back in I had to go through a set of breakers, big rock walls with a gap between them that prevented waves blasting into a canal. This particular day the speed and the direction of the wind kicked up some waves that were just the right height and distance apart that I couldn’t handle them. The waves weren’t big but I was having an issue with something called broaching. I couldn’t surf the waves quite right because they were steep enough that with less power I wouldn’t have good control and with more power I’d go over the wave, hit the trough of the wave in front, and the whole boat would try to kick itself sideways and would likely capsize. I was able to keep alternating power and trimmed way the hell up so my bow wouldn’t handle them as poorly, but it was still a struggle getting in and I was seriously thinking I was gonna end up capsizing the entire time. I only had to crest maybe five or six waves to actually get through the breakers but each one I was nervous as hell for. I made it but that was the last time I ever took that boat past the breakers. 

I guess these aren’t like, creepy as in paranormal or anything like that, but they definitely freaked me the hell out….Fun times, psa parents, don’t give your kids boats/let them pull them out of other peoples yards and jerry rig them to run with spare parts from a ford tempo and gasket sealant, bad plan."

When I was just shy of 15, we moved to Ventura, California. I met a classic ""surfer girl"". Everything a 15 yo could want, she was 16, had a car, her mother's VW bug, and she thought the fact that I could ride horses, was a tiny bit American Indian, and grew up on a ranch was the coolest thing ever.

So, I learned to surf, of course. Loved it. Made friends with some of the other surfers. Everyone called me Jethro, or Cowboy. So, we're all sitting in about thirty feet of water and Mako darts under us. My tanned hide turned white as a sheet. All the kids were a little nervous, honestly.

It made a couple of circles and moved away. We all just went back to surfing. When we moved back to Oklahoma, I was telling a friend and my mother flipped the hell out like I'd almost been kidnapped by a creep from a PSA.

""OH MY GOD! Why didn't you tell me?""

Really, mom? That's the story that makes you shake and shudder? Wow. I dodged feral hogs, thrown from horses, charged by bulls and mama cows, and rode around in the beds of picks ups with my grandfather bucking hay. My mother was a single mom and we lived in a terrible neighborhood in a small blue collar town until I was 13. Gangs, drugs, child rapists. But, that was the one that turned her full Karen. LMAO."

One of the better assignments I was put on was identifying whale sharks in the Ningaloo Reef area, not far off of the coast of Western Australia. My job was to swim next to the shark as it cruised past and take pictures, which would then be used to identify and create a record of the shark. It was really interesting how they did it, I was told they used the same program that NASA used to map the stars to ID the sharks based on their unique spot patterns. 

Whale sharks are harmless to people, and generally pretty indifferent to divers, but they're the kind of massive that's hard to appreciate until you see one up close. I think it was on my second or third dive that we were told of a particularly big shark by the spotters (about 9-10 metres, they get a lot bigger but the ones in this area are nearly all juvenile males). We jumped in and waited for it to cruise past, but this one took an unexpected turn and was swimming very quickly towards us. I kicked like crazy and managed to get out of its way, but it missed me by barely a foot. 

I was never in any real danger, worst case it would have just bumped me out of the way, but seeing a fish with a head the size of an SUV hurtling toward you underwater is something else."

This fin was more triangular with a serrated back side (almost like a steak knife) with a sandpaper looking texture. Dolphins have more scoop in their fin and very smooth texture on their skin.

The way it swam gave me instant chills- fishy, more side to side and straight than the classic up and down, coming up for breath dolphin. 

I froze. Trying to control my panic, waited for it to disappear and as smoothly as possible, turned my board around, paddled through the pier back to land.

Just as I’m about to pop up onto the board I take a final quick glance back to make sure all is good and a huge creature explodes out of the face of the wave right next to me. I panic and bail, scared shitless, and if felt like I did a cartoon run on top of the water how fast I got all the way in to shore. On the beach it there are people watching and talking about it as it was still out there playing in the waves. It looked like a huge dolphin but people thought it might be a pilot whale."

Around where I grew up there was an assortment of U shaped little cove things. A whole series of them UUUU that were surrounded by very tall cliffs. The only way out when the tide came in and cut you off was to sprint for it and hope you get to a U that has an exit (most dont) or just kinda wait until low tide, and hope high tide isn't that high. The cliffs mean you can't phone for help either so beyond yelling you see fucked. 

Swimming for it is a great way to get dashed against the rocks or drowned. For me once it gets to about upper thigh level you are really taking your life into your own hands wading back. 

It almost got me as a teen on many occasions. On one occasion I had to climb up the cliffs. Thank God I had rock climbing experiance. One time I did swim for it and very nearly drowned. 

Folks get caught out all the time by it. They just take the dog for a nice little walk along the beach and suddenly find themselves cut off by very strong tides pinned between that and a giant cliff. Low tide is perfectly safe. Incoming high tide is absolurely not. 

I was in one of the cave systems (not that deep really no torch needed for example) and lost track of time. By the time I got back to the entrance the waves had eroded a lot of the sand. It went from a sand walkway up to the cave to the end of the cave spitting out to a drop where I couldn't feel the bottom. Rapidly deteriorating. Cut my hands up on the rocks bouldering to the side to get around to where it was safe again. The place is a bloody death trap. 

Actually inside the water? 

On holiday I once trod on a very large stingray. Maybe 40cm across? Luckily I trod on part of it that wasn't the stinger and didn't step down hard - it simply felt my foot and split. I had no idea it was even there until i saw and felt it moving. 

When I was maybe 14, I was at the beach and ran down into the water while my mam was messing around doing something. I am standing out there chest high in the water waving and my mam just starts screaming. I didn't even notice at the time but I was basically standing in the middle of a jellyfish swarm. I know they weren't there when I got into the water. I am not *that* oblivious. The jellyfish were not harmful a bit of vinegar (I think) and the sting doesn't even hurt anymore. My mother didn't know that. I didn't get stung but she did when she charged into the water to drag me out while I was just calmly and slowly exiting. Apparently calm movements were not appropriate for the situation in her eyes. 

I did a tour of the local lifeguard place once and those folks have one hell of a dark humor. What stuck with me though; the main boat they use has a small sealed cabin. Apparently they could fit like 30 people on as rescues Inc staff. 6 of us were on (Inc staff) and it was uncomfortably snug. They then go on to say that the control cabin is sealed but most rescues would be on the deck part. If conditions caused a flip the crew would be safe, right the boat, and then buzz around picking eveyone back out of the water. To me this both makes absolute sense and also is very distressing. Imagine nearly drowning and then being punted back into the ocean along with God knows how many people. Horrifying. 

Octopus are also super smart. I saw one on a dive once, a daytime dive, just mooching around. As we approached it took off (no ink tho) towards this random rock maybe 5m away. We followed at a distance and I saw it dive into a hole in that rock and then *pick up a rock from inside the hole and use it to plug the hole from the inside*. Just **slam** no soliciting. 

Let me tell you that hysterical laughter with a regulator isn't ideal. Only one other person on the dive saw it and was also in fits. Nobody knew why both of us had suddenly gotten ourselves into apparent distress at the exact same time. You won't drown or anything but it can be a little uncomfortable and other folks will think you are in trouble esp if your mask starts to fill up as mine did. We had to end the dive a bit early because the hysterical laughter used up more oxygen than was expected. We gave a bunch of ok's but you could tell eveyone else was on edge and keeping a close eye. My mam was with me on that dive and wouldn't ever get more than about 2ft from me after it. Presumably worried I will drown. She still complains about it *'I thought you were having a seizure'*. 

The good side of the octopus incident is that folks knew exactly what to do and eveyone sprung into action. I was offered several spare regs pretty much the moment folks noticed my breathing and body position was incorrect the dive group split into 2 to deal with each of us seperatly. Someone got right up in my face and looked me in the eyes and checked all my kit to try and figure out the issue and folks prepared the inital steps to quit the dive. I gave the OK multiple times but nobody fully belived me which I kinda get. I had to bat my mam away from my float vest because she was ready to make me go up regardless of my opinion of the matter (I am an adult and was at the time but some habits I guess admittedly I would have done exactly the same to her if I thought she was going to drown). It wasn't scary for me but it was for her. She was of the opinion she was watching her eldest child about to die. For the entire rest of the dive if I so much as paused she was all over me like a rash!"

I was nervous initially when visited my first wreck as I thought I would find them foreboding and spooky (like if you stand next to a big truck or a train that’s parked!) but as soon as the wreck loomed out of the blue I was excited to go inside. 

My spookiest experience was diving a wreck off Gozo, Malta. I was down in the engine room of a 58m-long passenger ship, c40m deep at that point in the dive. It was dark, we were early in the day but some silt disturbed and vis was poor in the room. The ship is at a slight list, and as we circled the engine room and went to go back up my brain scrambled at the slightly off-level angle of the stairs as they came into view. 

I felt a pang of pure confusion and realised it was potentially the effects of disorientation mixed with gas-narcosis (40m here). 

I had to say to myself ‘hey, you know what this is, it’s fine’ followed my Buddy to the deck above and felt fine after that. 

I’m fortunate to be diving with a very experienced buddy (DM) and guide and have visited that particular wreck a number of times. It was the first time I had recognised feeling narc’ed and made me a better diver for the experience- the moment of pure brain fog was a reminder that shit can get serious very quickly at any depth. I can imagine that my short moment of disorientation mixed with challenging conditions or gear malfunction would have been a problem. 

If you want to see the stairs and wreck there’s loads of  pics online- search ‘MV Karwela’ and you’ll see!"

I'm going out on the great barrier reef tomorrow and I'm hoping one of the dives will be a SCUBA drift dive. Basically you get dropped usually directly in deep water and the current pulls you along the ocean wall you're diving against to where the boat picks you up again.

However, sometimes on drift dives, you start just in a shallow coral outcrop. You drop in where it's maybe 10m deep, then you swim towards the outer edge of the reef and....nothing. There is a literal cliff that drops off from 10m down to about 1000ft or more that fades from light blue to inky black as you look down. Because the bottom continues out due to the reef several miles out from the shore, there's no continental shelf gradual drop off. When the reef ends, there's nothing but a cliff 1000ft or more deep. You drift along this cliff and stay above 30m to see the corals, plants and wildlife that live along the edge. Because of the current, nutrients are floating by everyday constantly refreshed, so the wildlife is abundant.

When you come from the shallows and reach the cliff it is exhilarating. I don't find it terrifying, because I feel at home in the water and the ocean doesn't scare me (some of the things in it do...). I get this enormous sense of...emptiness. But not fear. If anything, loneliness. Because when you're looking out from that shelf, the next thing you would reach if you swam directly out is Peru or Chile nearly 11000 miles away...."

He had this cool diving watch, which gave you active depth readings, so while swimming i'd go subsurface and touch the ocean floor, check the depth and come back up. 10feet....20feet and then we reached this little bump, in the middle of the sea and the water was at knee level - so we had to walk across it. After walking for maybe 20 metres - it just disappeared, and there was a bottomless drop, i couldn't see the ocean floor. It was spooky but freeing of sorts, i love the ocean. We continued swimming for maybe an hour more and came back to the shore. One of my favourite memories"

So burning it makes it somewhat less bad for the environment. 

Leaking methane is a big problem also for gas infrastructure. Just a few percent of leakage mean that gas is just as or more climate damaging than coal. However, in many countries methane emissions are not really monitored, in contrast to CO2 emissions. 

It is a big unknown for the climate change. We just know that methane emissions are rising from satellite measurements, but not really from where."

If something was to happen that prevented the normal equipment from handling gases (such as a power outage, trip of a gas compressor, high pressure in a separator), they're sent to the flare to be burned in a controlled manner so there's no chance they collect and potentially explode.

Flares are used by some to routinely dispose of produced gases, but this isn't their only purpose. In the US, routine flaring of gases is banned on deepwater platforms. 

Especially offshore, produced gases have a few uses: fuel for gas turbine generators to make electricity (the primary form of powering an offshore platform), gas lifting wells, and sales gas."

I've worked with a couple platforms that were converted to operate with a ""cold flare"" where the waste gases are used in power generation in the turbines. In an emergency situation where the system needs to blow down and exhaust to the flare, it's very important that it be lit.

The flare is normally purged with nitrogen gas so that there should be no chance of ignition in the pipe. When a blow down occurs, an automatic system launches a magnesium rod that sparks all the way up to the top and lights the flare. The system will try again a few times until it is successful. If not, someone can hopefully come out and launch an emergency rocket like in the video."

Edit: replying to a pro Russian tankie below, and think the truth needs more visibility, so decided to copy it here:

[ Russia didn’t go any further into Georgia in 2008 precisely because there was US troop in Georgia at the time for a military exercise with Georgia and Ukraine. To think Russia wouldn’t go any further in Ukraine (BTW further than what? They literally was gonna occupy the capital) without western support is idiotic.

Also, whether you agree to US action or not, US intervention in Yugoslavia, Kuwait, Syria, Lybia, Afghanistan all have UNSC resolution granting the permission for intervention (remember Russia has the power to veto, but they abstained or voted for these resolutions) , does Russia have that for invasion of Georgia and Ukraine? Hmm?]"

To think Russia wouldn’t go any further in Ukraine (BTW further than what? They literally was gonna occupy the capital) without western support is idiotic.

Also, whether you agree to US action or not, US intervention in Yugoslavia, Kuwait, Syria, Lybia, Afghanistan all have UNSC resolution granting the permission for intervention (remember Russia has the power to veto, but they abstained or voted for these resolutions) , does Russia have that for invasion of Georgia and Ukraine? Hmm?]"

As an exercise example, I kept falling into the trap of trying to reset my workouts to where I'd been at prior to gaining weight. So I'd plan workouts like a 5 mile run, or an hour of crossfit. I'd do the workouts for a couple weeks, but lose steam because they just highlighted how far I'd fallen, left me exhausted, and eroded my willpower. Instead I started easy--just go for an intentional 1 mile walk every single day. It didn't take long to start upping the distance, adding in hills, picking up the pace, jogging sections, etc. I did that for months before the workouts ever felt intense, by which time I was better prepared both physically and mentally.

Same deal with eating. Instead of all salads no nachos, I started with just saying to myself, eat whatever you want but you are only allowed to use a small plate. Over time I added other things I could consistently commit to, like using MyFitnessPal to roughly track caloric intake, adding one day of fasting a week, limiting sugar/booze, etc.

What you need to do is figure out what caused you to be the weight that you are. For some people it's a food addiction, for some people it's depression and eating for comfort, in my case it was that I didnt really care much about my appearance or health and spent zero effort on my diet and didn't exercise much. What I needed was motivation. I had no problem fasting or cutting the amount I eat, I had no problem with eating less pleasant but more nutritious food, and I didn't have much of a problem getting into a workout routine. I just didn't have motivation to do it because my health wasn't something I considered much and I was with a woman who always said she preferred guys that were a little overweight and had a dad bod. I didn't have anyone else I cared to impress so I didn't see a point in making the effort. Eventually tho I started to gain more weight and it got to the point where she said, in a very nice way, that I'd probably look better if I lost a bit of weight. Hearing that was instant motivation for me and so with her in mind I managed to lose quite a bit of weight (around 130 pounds total). By the end of that I was feeling so much better, I no longer was out of breath so easily, and it got to the point where, even without her for motivation, I can't see letting myself gain the weight back."

You're at a restaurant, you see a lean meat and veg or a creamy pasta.  You say to yourself,  well I'm a thin person and thin people eat healthy foods regularly,  I'll order the lean meat and veg like other thin people.  

You see a plate of cookies at work.  How many does a thin person take? Maybe just 1. You're thin so obviously you should only take 1.

Stairs or elevator? Well thin people take the stairs,  you're a thin person so you take the stairs.  

Take small portions,  you can always get more if you *need* but remember thin people feel full quicker because they eat slowly and eat when they're hungry not just because it tastes good,  so you're eating slow and checking for fullness before getting seconds. 

Eventually these choices become habit and you never once ""punish"" or ""deprive"" yourself.  You're taking 1 cookie because thin people,  like yourself,  only eat 1, not because you're a fatty who needs to lose weight and eat less.  It's a great way to change your mind set,  change your habits, and not beat yourself up which can lead to backslides and failed weight loss.

Calorie reduction, it’s simple. There’s no fancy diet that works better than any others, the only possible way to lose weight is to eat less than you burn.

How I did it: My biggest problem, as with most fat people, is impulse control. I simply could not keep myself in check for 100% of the day. I could be good for most of the day, but at some point I was going to have a moment of weakness and stop at a gas station to get a slutty candy bar or something. Knowing this about myself, I determined the issue was access. If I had access to bad food, I was going to get it. I needed to figure out how to limit my access.

The solution: I stopped bringing my check card to work. If I don’t have money, I can’t buy food. To be clear, I am not recommending this at all. I would sometimes go almost 24 hours without eating and it was detrimental to my energy levels and mood. The positives were I lost 100lbs and saved a ton of money, I just can’t in good conscience say someone else should do the same thing. It’s just what worked for me."

\- think of it as a permanent change in lifestyle rather than temporary. Change habits and stick to them. Don't think: x until lose y, but x because that's what I need. If its not something you'll be able to stay with, its not worth the pain.

\- change the habit and get used to it, then gradually change more habits.

\- Do not keep measuring it by weight - wait for the good habits to work. Don't be counting grams. If you've done the change that you should, your life will improve. Keep doing it and you'll be going ""wth these pants are dropping?""

\- don't lie to yourself. You know what you should have and not. \*You know\*. Talk to yourself as if you were a friend seeing his other friend do crap.

\- know you are allowed some days off - and its not a cheat, its a part of the lifestyle. But don't schedule it - do it when its worth it. Friday night with friends? Good. Friday night alone? Not worth it.

\- on the same logical path -  when you have a day off, or a special treat, do it deliberately and for a good reason - like a good chocolate - and then enjoy it. As a corollary, if its not good quality, ""it's not worth it!"". This helped me pass by a lot of stuff.

\- do not buy the stuff you should not eat. Once in the home, you've lost.

\- be proud of yourself when you resist a temptation. And set the damn thing away from your sight.

\- drop carbs, go more for protein and fat. It fills you up more.

Weight loss and getting healthy takes time and patience. 

I’d start by finding out an estimate of your calories burnt in a day or TDEE, total daily energy expenditure (there are a few good calculators online for this) and shoot for a caloric intake lower than that but not so low that you’re uncomfortable and start coming up with an exercise routine to supplement. Even if it’s just walking in the evenings it’s still getting you up and going."

I started out still eating poorly but limiting it to 2p - 6p and I did this for a month - arbys, McDonald’s, firehouse - all of that. I lost ten pounds. 

It made sense since I went from three fatty meals a day to one or two. Then I started drinking diet soda and lost another five lbs. then Jeff suggested I start making the most of my four hours. With healthy options. I went from Big Macs to Blue Apron and back to Panera. I started choosing healthier meals. 

It’s not always perfect and lord knows I’m not bikini ready. But I went from xxxl to xl in a month. I had to pull over and use the restroom at a grocery store on the way home every day or I would get sick. That stopped immediately.

My favorite go to is pan fried salmon and pan fried Brussel sprouts. I still love soda but I do mostly zero sugar these days - which I realize is still bad- but I’m doing a lot better than I was. 

Within six months I went from having to buy my bras at Lane Bryant to finally being able to buy a bra at Victorias Secret. 

I know they are owned by the same company . 

And another tip - get a bra that fits . It makes all the difference in your body and your self esteem!! Get measured for one!"

1) Weight loss is a numbers game, you need to move more and eat less to make any real progress.

2) Count your calories, you don’t know how much you need to move if you don’t know how much fuel you are giving your body that needs to be burned off.

3) Vary your meals, you aren’t a robot and will get bored if you try to eat the same things at the same times every day.

4) There is nothing wrong with the occasional treat, you still need to enjoy life. You should still count the calories, but you also shouldn’t beat yourself up for having a treat meal every week.

5) Drink lots of water. A fully stomach of water is still a full stomach and it can help get rid of hunger pangs during the early days.

6) Change your framing of what you are doing, you’re not on a “diet” but you’ve “changed your diet”. A diet sounds like it is temporary whilst changing your diets sounds permanent, meaning you’re more likely to stick with it.

7) Change your diet alongside someone else. You will likely falter at some point, but it’s likely that you and someone else won’t falter at the same time, meaning you can lean on and gain strength from somebody else’s willpower when yours is weakened.

8) Try to have fun and enjoy it. Yes, I’d rather sit on the sofa and play video games, but I can walk the dog and listen to a podcast at the local park. 

9) Everybody, and every body, is different - what works for me won’t necessarily work for you. Find what you can do &amp; enjoy and keep doing them.

10) It isn’t a race, you’ll get there."

People's biggest problems seem to be portion control and snacking (snacks include soda and juice). I think the biggest thing you can do is just cutting out snacks in between meals and sticking to JUST plain ol' water.

Nobody needs 2 sandwiches. You don't need 2 sides for any meal. Hell, a handful of chips is totally fine if you can reasonably judge what a ""handful"" should be. You don't need 4 pieces of fried fish. You don't need to eat a whole Tupperware container of pasta salad. A bowl of cereal shouldn't be more than a cup and a half and it is not part of a meal, it's the whole fuckin meal.

And goddamn. DRINK WATER. Tap, bottled, purified, spring. Doesn't matter. Drink fucking WATER. And you don't need to add a flavorant to it. Just drink the goddamn water!

You're an animal. You have evolved to consume. You have also evolved to be smarter than your stomach. We live in a world of outrageous abundance where, if you wanted, you could just eat yourself to death. Just because you can, doesn't mean you should.

Edit: I should also add, STAY AWAY FROM THE MICROWAVE. Convenience is the enemy of weight loss. Cut the microwavables out of your fridge. When you actually need to put a little effort into preparing your food, you'll be less inclined to just eat whenever and only put that effort in during meal times."

I started counting calories, cut down from 2200 to 1500 calories, and eventually determined that I could easily do with 1400. This typically translated to \~300 calories for breakfast, \~400 calories for lunch, \~100 calories for one mid-afternoon snack, \~600 calories for dinner. Drink lots of water. I also ensured I ended dinner \~7pm on a full stomach, and went to bed \~11:30, so by breakfast time, its 12 hour fasting.

I also used to do blood glucose testing using rapid home tests, and even during mid-day, my blood glucose would be fasting level. Which means I was burning stored fat even during the day. If you walk around and burn 100-200 calories, thats extra weight loss!

Started losing weight immediately at \~3 lbs/week. After losing 40 lbs, I stopped and with similar lifestyle regimen, have maintained the new weight for over an year now.

As others have said here, there is no secret magic pill really. Its just calorie restriction. I don't have time to exercise 1 hour, and so that wouldn't fit my lifestyle. Calorie restriction is easy to implement. You begin to see weight loss in a week, which gives you positive reinforcement to continue on later. But you have to do it first for a week."

The idea that you’ll get to a healthy weight and then magically be able to maintain it with less effort is not true (the “maintenance phase” thing). And CICO is a huge oversimplification, as metabolism is a complicated system that adapts when we diet - so it’s impossible to really accurately know your “tdee” based on your age/height/weight/activity. People interested should look up the Biggest Loser where are they nows - the extreme dieting contestants went through fucked up their metabolisms so much that they have to eat way fewer calories than other people their same height/weight or they will gain. 

My advice (as someone who lost 70lbs and went from a BMI of 35 to 23). Don’t diet. Don’t count calories. Don’t try to lose weight. I eat 1000 calories a day to maintain my weight, while every calculator says my tdee even without doing anything should be higher than that. If I hadn’t started from an obese weight, I 100 percent would fit every criteria for an eating disorder. But instead I’m a “success story.” 95% of diets don’t fail because every fat person is lazy, but because they do not work. Unless you lose your mind like I did. And we as a society didn’t suddenly get fat because everyone mysteriously got lazy at the same time, but because our food system is a mess full of hormones and additives. If your body doesn’t respond to them by slowing your metabolism while turning up the hunger cues, you just got lucky. Some people literally are hungrier than others of their exact same size and activity level. And putting the responsibility for that on the individuals suffering from its effects helps no one. Not to mention that so many people have dieted their way to weighing so much more than if they had just accepted that they were 30lbs overweight or whatever. (And I promise many of them have responded here.)

So yeah what actually worked was eating &lt;500 calories a day for weeks on end and prioritizing weight loss over everything else in my life. Now I live in terror of regain and am hungry all the time. It rules my life and the kicker is that I am less healthy than when I was fat in every measurable way. I used to run a morning 5k multiple times a week and could easily carry 50lb boxes at work, and there’s no way in hell I could do those things now. If you are fat - eat healthy because it’s good for you. Workout because it’s fun and makes you strong. Do not diet. It. will. not. work. 

It only *looks* like it worked for me. This disordered way of living is not a success in any way."

Constipated people don't eat. So, they waste away. It's why detoxing cocaine users shit their clothes. Losing the coke stops the constipation, so everything lets go. So, yeah, coke or crack are guaranteed to help you lose weight. Some of the other side effects may be undesirable. Your mileage may vary.

I know a guy whose father said would detox him. He locked him in a windowless room in the basement with two buckets. One bucket was full of drinking water. The other bucket was his toilet. He was in there for 8 days and nights. He said that he was in agony, and that he hallucinated, to the point where he swears that he saw the face of God.

That was a couple of years ago, and he hasn't touched it since. 

Oh, yeah, he's put on a bit of weight too."

Add to that the Russian government lurching around desperately like a bull in a China shop taking foreign businesses over and threatening to nationalise them is pure poison to business.

&gt; The number of Chinese companies that have suspended operations in the Russian market has now reached five, following drone maker DJI&amp;#039;s decision to halt business activities in Russia and Ukraine this week.

&gt; According to the Yale team, is Chinese phone maker Huawei, which has suspended new orders but, like UnionPay, is continuing its existing operations in Russia.

&gt; Unlike companies in the West, Chinese firms are unlikely to face the same public scrutiny experienced by their American or European counterparts, hundreds of which pulled out of Russia on public sentiment alone.

There’s a fair chance the rouble is going to go into free fall once the Russian government reaches the end of its ability to prop it up - which might be sooner then people think. And defaulting on their debt is  not a great look either (understatement). 

Add to that the Russian government lurching around desperately like a bull in a China shop taking foreign businesses over and threatening to nationalise them is pure poison to business. Even if Russia dropped its war in Ukraine tomorrow, paid reparations and started to get sanctions reversed this alone would scare off most foreign investment for years if not the next decade or two. It’s just too unpredictable: who is to say if they might not start some other war next year or do something else irrational? 

Business doesn’t always hate war but what it really does hate is unpredictably - and having to factor in not only the infamous levels of Russian corruption but that the government could randomly steal or make any investment worthless overnight. It makes the risk vs reward calculation much less appealing."

&gt; The number of Chinese companies that have suspended operations in the Russian market has now reached five, following drone maker DJI&amp;#039;s decision to halt business activities in Russia and Ukraine this week.

&gt; According to the Yale team, is Chinese phone maker Huawei, which has suspended new orders but, like UnionPay, is continuing its existing operations in Russia.

&gt; Unlike companies in the West, Chinese firms are unlikely to face the same public scrutiny experienced by their American or European counterparts, hundreds of which pulled out of Russia on public sentiment alone.

After the reporter asked the first question, Lavrov was basically spouting the same lie, that they do this because some countries (wink wink) does not adhere to the Minsk Agreement, and they do this to protect the integrity of sovereignty and territory (didn’t say of whom though).

And the UNSG jumped in and said there are a lot of ways under UN Charter to resolve grievances and speaking of integrity of sovereignty and territory he’d like to remind everyone that it’s Russian troops in Ukraine not the other way around.

Edit: replying to a pro Russian tankie below, and think the truth needs more visibility, so decided to copy it here:

[ Russia didn’t go any further into Georgia in 2008 precisely because there was US troop in Georgia at the time for a military exercise with Georgia and Ukraine. To think Russia wouldn’t go any further in Ukraine (BTW further than what? They literally was gonna occupy the capital) without western support is idiotic.

Also, whether you agree to US action or not, US intervention in Yugoslavia, Kuwait, Syria, Lybia, Afghanistan all have UNSC resolution granting the permission for intervention (remember Russia has the power to veto, but they abstained or voted for these resolutions) , does Russia have that for invasion of Georgia and Ukraine? Hmm?]"

The day after my daughter was born I had to wait until 12pm for my husband to show up to see me and the baby and he and his mom were only there 45 min before they decided to go get lunch and they didn’t even come back to the hospital! I drove myself home the next day. I to this day dread her coming to visit."

Let me add, this is my dad's old computer and I inherited it after he passed away at the age of 12. 

Instead of getting at least an apology my parents brushed it off and told me that I was irresponsible for putting stuffed animals over a computer, like it was expected for the little ones to jump on them even after I told them no.

His name was Andrew and I mostly was friends with him cause of his mental and anger problems. He would be the weird kid in the class. Tall, skinny, and did random things at recess. But if you made him mad, he would be out for you. One time he was mad and I tried to talk to him and he hit me out of rage. Another time I was at a birthday sleepover with him and when I won, he choked me. But the time I couldn't take it was when he came over while my cousin was at my grandmother's house with me. We were playing on my system and my younger cousin was playing with an unplugged controller (a typical thing to do.) We took turns playing. If you lost, you'd give it to the person not playing. My cousin lost and I wanted to be nice and give her another turn. At the time I was showing the younger cousin how to take turns and I was asking if the younger cousin could give me the controller. I repeatedly asked and Andrew thought that I was talking to the cousin who was playing. He said to her disrespectfully to give the controller to me. She said to him that I said she could play again. After a very short time of arguing, he ripped the controller out of her hand, hurting her, and with an aggressive face, handed it to me. What is wrong with you? I said to him and walked out to my cousin. I forgot to mention that when she passed my room earlier, Andrew said something rude to her silently. Not only that, but when my younger cousin asked to play, he slammed the door on her. I decided that I would finally stop trying to help him and just not be his friend anymore. At the time it was hard cause he was the only other friend I had at the time. My grandmother said it was the right thing to do and I'm glad I'm not his friend anymore."

2. Another drunk friend of a friend wouldn't stop arguing with other guests and almost got into a fight with my friend in the balcony, we had to break it up and pretend everyone was leaving so he would fuck off. He tried laying down on my couch after throwing up but i didn't let him pass out. Had to get him out.

3. Another drunk friend was at my place all night and kept drinking beers after we finished the whiskey. I fell asleep early. The next morning I go downstairs with him to drop him off. He had stayed up all night and drove my car in the middle of the night to get food. This fucker can't even handle a few drinks yet stole my car in the middle of the night.

I came back in the next day after they left to grab my computer. I couldn't find it and when I did it just so happened to be right under the blankets and stuffed animals.

Let me add, this is my dad's old computer and I inherited it after he passed away at the age of 12. 

Instead of getting at least an apology my parents brushed it off and told me that I was irresponsible for putting stuffed animals over a computer, like it was expected for the little ones to jump on them even after I told them no. They knew what was under the stuffed animals and blankets. They were old enough to know not to as well. It just makes me angry to know that they were that disrespectful to others things."

His name was Andrew and I mostly was friends with him cause of his mental and anger problems. He would be the weird kid in the class. Tall, skinny, and did random things at recess. But if you made him mad, he would be out for you. One time he was mad and I tried to talk to him and he hit me out of rage. Another time I was at a birthday sleepover with him and when I won, he choked me. But the time I couldn't take it was when he came over while my cousin was at my grandmother's house with me. We were playing on my system and my younger cousin was playing with an unplugged controller (a typical thing to do.) We took turns playing. If you lost, you'd give it to the person not playing. My cousin lost and I wanted to be nice and give her another turn. At the time I was showing the younger cousin how to take turns and I was asking if the younger cousin could give me the controller. I repeatedly asked and Andrew thought that I was talking to the cousin who was playing. He said to her disrespectfully to give the controller to me. She said to him that I said she could play again. After a very short time of arguing, he ripped the controller out of her hand, hurting her, and with an aggressive face, handed it to me. What is wrong with you? I said to him and walked out to my cousin. I forgot to mention that when she passed my room earlier, Andrew said something rude to her silently. Not only that, but when my younger cousin asked to play, he slammed the door on her. I decided that I would finally stop trying to help him and just not be his friend anymore. At the time it was hard cause he was the only other friend I had at the time. My grandmother said it was the right thing to do and I'm glad I'm not his friend anymore."

I piled some of my stuff on the corner and my giant stuffed animal over it along with some blankets and pillows. 

My younger cousins are playing in my sisters room and decide to jump on the large blankets and stuffed animals from a bar on the side of my sisters bunk bed. After many times of telling them no they stopped. I walked out of the room, trusting them. 

I came back in the next day after they left to grab my computer. I couldn't find it and when I did it just so happened to be right under the blankets and stuffed animals. I opened it to see a crack across the screen. I asked my sister what happened, she now informed me that they did it more after I left. Let me add, this is my dad's old computer and I inherited it after he passed away at the age of 12. 

Instead of getting at least an apology my parents brushed it off and told me that I was irresponsible for putting stuffed animals over a computer, like it was expected for the little ones to jump on them even after I told them no. They knew what was under the stuffed animals and blankets. They were old enough to know not to as well. It just makes me angry to know that they were that disrespectful to others things."

His name was Andrew and I mostly was friends with him cause of his mental and anger problems. He would be the weird kid in the class. Tall, skinny, and did random things at recess. But if you made him mad, he would be out for you. One time he was mad and I tried to talk to him and he hit me out of rage. Another time I was at a birthday sleepover with him and when I won, he choked me. But the time I couldn't take it was when he came over while my cousin was at my grandmother's house with me. We were playing on my system and my younger cousin was playing with an unplugged controller (a typical thing to do.) We took turns playing. If you lost, you'd give it to the person not playing. My cousin lost and I wanted to be nice and give her another turn. At the time I was showing the younger cousin how to take turns and I was asking if the younger cousin could give me the controller. I repeatedly asked and Andrew thought that I was talking to the cousin who was playing. He said to her disrespectfully to give the controller to me. She said to him that I said she could play again. After a very short time of arguing, he ripped the controller out of her hand, hurting her, and with an aggressive face, handed it to me. What is wrong with you? I said to him and walked out to my cousin. I forgot to mention that when she passed my room earlier, Andrew said something rude to her silently. Not only that, but when my younger cousin asked to play, he slammed the door on her. I decided that I would finally stop trying to help him and just not be his friend anymore. At the time it was hard cause he was the only other friend I had at the time. My grandmother said it was the right thing to do and I'm glad I'm not his friend anymore."

My cousin lost and I wanted to be nice and give her another turn. At the time I was showing the younger cousin how to take turns and I was asking if the younger cousin could give me the controller. I repeatedly asked and Andrew thought that I was talking to the cousin who was playing. He said to her disrespectfully to give the controller to me. She said to him that I said she could play again. After a very short time of arguing, he ripped the controller out of her hand, hurting her, and with an aggressive face, handed it to me. What is wrong with you? I said to him and walked out to my cousin. I forgot to mention that when she passed my room earlier, Andrew said something rude to her silently. Not only that, but when my younger cousin asked to play, he slammed the door on her. I decided that I would finally stop trying to help him and just not be his friend anymore. At the time it was hard cause he was the only other friend I had at the time. My grandmother said it was the right thing to do and I'm glad I'm not his friend anymore."

At some point this girl had to go to the toilet. She did her thing and she came back smelling like poo so my mom checked the bathroom and there was shit everywhere, on the walls the toilet itself everything was covered in shit

*****
&gt; Thanks to efforts to diversify oil suppliers and with support from the Polish government, Germany is days away from being independent of Russian oil, Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck said.

&gt; In 2021, oil imports from Russia had constituted about 35% of Germany&amp;#039;s oil consumption, while the East German refineries in Schwedt, owned by Russian state company Rosneft, and Leuna, rely entirely on Russian crude.

&gt; After weeks of hard work, Germany has come &amp;quot;Very, very close&amp;quot; to being able to rid itself entirely of Russian oil, said Habeck on a visit to Warsaw on 26 April.

Due to the contracts Germany has with Russia, Germany has to pay for the gas until 2030. They have contracts in the Take or Pay style. Germany has to buy at least 40 billion m^3 natural gas. If they don’t take the gas they still have to pay.

I really, really hate this argument (as a German, so probably biased), because it makes it seem that this was purely a benefical choice from Germany: ""They bought cheap Russian gas because they were greedy and didn't listen to the world hehehe it serves them right now!"".

Everyone forgets that it was a deliberate decision to intertwine both economies (German economy AND Russian economy) so that a major Russian aggression (e.g. Ukraine) wouldn't happen as it was basically deemed as suicidal for Russia.

Yes, it was benefical for Germany. Yes, Germany could have developed an alternative way for gas as well. But it was a state doctrine to tie Germany and Russia together: **if one falls, the other is going to fall with them for the sake of peace in Europe.**

Why is this not being discussed in the world? I don't get it honestly. It was (imo) a pretty good theory. Sadly, it obviously didn't work but in hindsight you are always smarter."

As someone on the autism spectrum myself I completely disagree with nearly everything they've pushed. On top of that organizations that wish to ""cure autism"" are even more ridiculous. First off Autism is not a disease, you can't ""cure"" it. Second off autism is not a bad thing, some cases aren't even noticeable, and pushing that it is a ""bad"" thing (which it most certainly is not) only further stigmatizes the disorder as well as the people with it. It is perfectly fine to be different from everyone else, don't let crap organizations like Autism Speaks or any other unreliable mental health organizations say deter you from achieving what you want to in life.

Edit: to clarify, I mention that autism is not a bad thing, I do not mean it is a good thing either. Everyone's experiences with it are different so I can never speak for everyone even as someone diagnosed with it. I just believe that it shouldn't be treated as if it is a bad thing for everybody going through it, we should treat people with autism with the respect and care they truly deserve, and we shouldn't have organizations like Autism Speaks tell us otherwise."

They would protest, and there would always be a counter protest, and people would just bully the shit out of them the entire time Westboro was protesting. It got so bad that they had to scale back both the amount of protests they were doing and how many people were going, and no longer brought their kids with them.

As someone on the autism spectrum myself I completely disagree with nearly everything they've pushed. On top of that organizations that wish to ""cure autism"" are even more ridiculous. First off Autism is not a disease, you can't ""cure"" it. Second off autism is not a bad thing, some cases aren't even noticeable, and pushing that it is a ""bad"" thing (which it most certainly is not) only further stigmatizes the disorder as well as the people with it. It is perfectly fine to be different from everyone else, don't let crap organizations like Autism Speaks or any other unreliable mental health organizations say deter you from achieving what you want to in life.

Edit: to clarify, I mention that autism is not a bad thing, I do not mean it is a good thing either. Everyone's experiences with it are different so I can never speak for everyone even as someone diagnosed with it. I just believe that it shouldn't be treated as if it is a bad thing for everybody going through it, we should treat people with autism with the respect and care they truly deserve, and we shouldn't have organizations like Autism Speaks tell us otherwise."

And then something amazing happened. Westboro started getting bullied HARD by people in Kansas, like viciously and mercilessly bullied. They would protest, and there would always be a counter protest, and people would just bully the shit out of them the entire time Westboro was protesting. It got so bad that they had to scale back both the amount of protests they were doing and how many people were going, and no longer brought their kids with them.

As someone on the autism spectrum myself I completely disagree with nearly everything they've pushed. On top of that organizations that wish to ""cure autism"" are even more ridiculous. First off Autism is not a disease, you can't ""cure"" it. Second off autism is not a bad thing, some cases aren't even noticeable, and pushing that it is a ""bad"" thing (which it most certainly is not) only further stigmatizes the disorder as well as the people with it. It is perfectly fine to be different from everyone else, don't let crap organizations like Autism Speaks or any other unreliable mental health organizations say deter you from achieving what you want to in life.

Edit: to clarify, I mention that autism is not a bad thing, I do not mean it is a good thing either. Everyone's experiences with it are different so I can never speak for everyone even as someone diagnosed with it. I just believe that it shouldn't be treated as if it is a bad thing for everybody going through it, we should treat people with autism with the respect and care they truly deserve, and we shouldn't have organizations like Autism Speaks tell us otherwise."

They would protest, and there would always be a counter protest, and people would just bully the shit out of them the entire time Westboro was protesting. It got so bad that they had to scale back both the amount of protests they were doing and how many people were going, and no longer brought their kids with them.

As someone on the autism spectrum myself I completely disagree with nearly everything they've pushed. On top of that organizations that wish to ""cure autism"" are even more ridiculous. First off Autism is not a disease, you can't ""cure"" it. Second off autism is not a bad thing, some cases aren't even noticeable, and pushing that it is a ""bad"" thing (which it most certainly is not) only further stigmatizes the disorder as well as the people with it. It is perfectly fine to be different from everyone else, don't let crap organizations like Autism Speaks or any other unreliable mental health organizations say deter you from achieving what you want to in life.

Edit: to clarify, I mention that autism is not a bad thing, I do not mean it is a good thing either. Everyone's experiences with it are different so I can never speak for everyone even as someone diagnosed with it. I just believe that it shouldn't be treated as if it is a bad thing for everybody going through it, we should treat people with autism with the respect and care they truly deserve, and we shouldn't have organizations like Autism Speaks tell us otherwise."

They would protest, and there would always be a counter protest, and people would just bully the shit out of them the entire time Westboro was protesting. It got so bad that they had to scale back both the amount of protests they were doing and how many people were going, and no longer brought their kids with them.

Edit: Jeez, when I went to bed last night this had 35 upvotes. Smarter minds have pointed out that the Oort Cloud is \*very\* far away and that I was thinking of the Kuiper Belt, which is a large collection of asteroids outside the orbit of Neptune. Still ridiculously far away, just not ludicrously far away.

Edit2: Just before this becomes an Elon Musk proxy war, this study is about 5 years old but they threw the kitchen sink at it, meaning they envisioned a utopia where all humanity sets aside its differences and dedicates all resources (including nukes) to deflection and it still wasn't enough. So perhaps SpaceX rockets will get there faster but all that means is we will fail sooner. Let's hope we get some encouraging data from DART."

Edit: Jeez, when I went to bed last night this had 35 upvotes. Smarter minds have pointed out that the Oort Cloud is \*very\* far away and that I was thinking of the Kuiper Belt, which is a large collection of asteroids outside the orbit of Neptune. Still ridiculously far away, just not ludicrously far away.

Edit2: Just before this becomes an Elon Musk proxy war, this study is about 5 years old but they threw the kitchen sink at it, meaning they envisioned a utopia where all humanity sets aside its differences and dedicates all resources (including nukes) to deflection and it still wasn't enough. So perhaps SpaceX rockets will get there faster but all that means is we will fail sooner. Let's hope we get some encouraging data from DART."

We’d basically have to identify the thing leaving the ~~Oort Cloud~~ Kuiper Belt.

Edit: Jeez, when I went to bed last night this had 35 upvotes. Smarter minds have pointed out that the Oort Cloud is \*very\* far away and that I was thinking of the Kuiper Belt, which is a large collection of asteroids outside the orbit of Neptune. Still ridiculously far away, just not ludicrously far away.

Edit2: Just before this becomes an Elon Musk proxy war, this study is about 5 years old but they threw the kitchen sink at it, meaning they envisioned a utopia where all humanity sets aside its differences and dedicates all resources (including nukes) to deflection and it still wasn't enough. So perhaps SpaceX rockets will get there faster but all that means is we will fail sooner. Let's hope we get some encouraging data from DART."

However, the EU Commission has been at loggerheads with Hungary's conservative Prime Minister Viktor Orban amid claims of his government misusing EU money and breaking the bloc's laws. Many observers also believe Orban is attempting to put courts and media under government's control.

Hungarian officials prompted outrage across the bloc last summer with its new law on LGBTQ+ groups.

In November, the EU's top court shot down the law, which punished people who help asylum-seekers, also known the ""Stop Soros"" law — a reference to the Hungarian-born Holocaust survivor and US-based billionaire George Soros.

Orban's Fidesz party has repeatedly targeted Soros in their campaigns and accused him of hiring media ""mercenaries"" to take down Orban's government.

More recently, Orban broke with the EU by saying he would be glad to pay for Russian gas in rubles.

Earlier this month, a Fidesz-led coalition secured an absolute majority at a parliamentary vote, putting Orban on track for a fourth term."

I've considered selling off my reddit and doing that as a monthly thing, so it probably just becomes bot spam after and eventually banned (which hopefully kills some value of the data on the account), but that's not good enough. Something to help me automatically upvote and provide clicks and activities on every page I view would be nice, but I feel like a trail could be discerned regardless. 

Best thing I can figure at the moment is sharing an account with multiple people of varying interests. I don't know if trying to emulate that enough to trick whatever systems are or will come out (you bet your ass they will crawl your old data with newer tech to squeeze all they can) is possible though without it seeming like filterable noise. 

I think they'll come up with anything and everything to get what they want, and a technical arms race of corporations vs individuals is kinda shit. The absolute best defense is them never getting your data, but it's nearly impossible these days. 

Tbh, I feel like the most effective effort would be moving heaven and earth for legislation to nip this shit in the bud, though the real time for that was a few years back."

&amp;#x200B;

Ignoring the societal impact (in many smaller towns, the local county will outright use facebook to announce construction and events), you aren't protecting your data as much as you think you are

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Possible things have changed since I read about this a few years back (so probably a lot worse now because obviously), but let's say Bill Smith deletes his account.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay. Well, Bill's sister Sue had a picture of them both in front of a McDonald's. Can't delete that because that belongs to the McDonald's on 7th street.. Also, we still have all this data on Sue's brother including where he went to school, where he worked in 2010, etc. So better preserve that because it is Sue's data.

And it is in the interest of Johnny Camp, the owner of that McDonald's, to have that relational data. So let's just make a phantom user 45678 that corresponds to all of Bill's old data. Also, we can derive from a post by John Schmidt that Sue Smith had a brother named Bill that is probably 45678 so let's add ""Bill Smith"" as a tentative name to that user.

&amp;#x200B;

Also, ad analytics suggest that the ""meta""  user ""I\_Like\_Big\_Titties\_420\_just\_Blaze\_It"" was at that McDonald's on 7th street at the exact same time as Bill and Sue so we should probably record that he has an interest in wooden spatulas and make an ad profile out of that and...

&amp;#x200B;

End result: Facebook has all the same data but now you have 100% zero control over it.

And a particularly cynical, borderline tinfoil hat, perspective I saw on that was that a LOT of the people advocating to ""delete your account"" on social media understand that and actively want to decouple you from that data. Facebook/Twitter/Reddit won't last forever and we are likely to see some form of consumer protection, if only out of Europe. So the faster they can make decoupled accounts with all the exact same data, the better.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Deleting accounts feels good. But you are probably better off deleting the content posted to that account and locking it down as much as you can while still keeping it active. Nothing is truly deleted either way, but that still gives you access to your file for whatever may come from that."

That's a very popular excuse - sure, it makes things **convenient** but if people are essential and important, _**you'll find a way**_ - I am extremely sociable and have lots of friends all around the world, and deactivated FB 5 years ago and don't have _any_ other social media profiles - we all make it work.

I'm going out on the great barrier reef tomorrow and I'm hoping one of the dives will be a SCUBA drift dive. Basically you get dropped usually directly in deep water and the current pulls you along the ocean wall you're diving against to where the boat picks you up again.

However, sometimes on drift dives, you start just in a shallow coral outcrop. You drop in where it's maybe 10m deep, then you swim towards the outer edge of the reef and....nothing. There is a literal cliff that drops off from 10m down to about 1000ft or more that fades from light blue to inky black as you look down. Because the bottom continues out due to the reef several miles out from the shore, there's no continental shelf gradual drop off. When the reef ends, there's nothing but a cliff 1000ft or more deep. You drift along this cliff and stay above 30m to see the corals, plants and wildlife that live along the edge. Because of the current, nutrients are floating by everyday constantly refreshed, so the wildlife is abundant.

When you come from the shallows and reach the cliff it is exhilarating. I don't find it terrifying, because I feel at home in the water and the ocean doesn't scare me (some of the things in it do...). I get this enormous sense of...emptiness. But not fear. If anything, loneliness. Because when you're looking out from that shelf, the next thing you would reach if you swam directly out is Peru or Chile nearly 11000 miles away...."

Very talented and smart, plus a nice guy.  At some point, he started making super strange decisions.  Kinda impulsive, very odd stuff (asking if he can invite his girlfriend to a staff meeting, for instance).  A lot of shit that didn’t make any sense.  He got hired to a better job and I lost touch.

A few months later, he died of a large number of brain tumors.  The timeline his girlfriend-turned-wife offered matched up with what we’d been noticing for years.

I look back in the arguments and realize there’s no way I could have known. At the same time, that’s kinda the point: you really *can’t* know what’s going on with someone, so act accordingly."

There was this guy who was notorious  for hitting on every girl possible over facebook. The very first, and only, conversation I had with him he asked me to blow him in the emergency stairwell at the mall then started hurling insults when I rejected him. Whole thing creeped me the hell out. Ended up blocking him and forget he existed until a few years ago when his face was front and centre on a news article circulating on facebook. He was 21 and was sexually harassing a 14 year old girl, which brought out a bunch of other shady shit he was doing involving minors, and how he’s in jail and a registered sex offender. Knew something wasn’t right about him but back in high school no one listened because “he’s so hot” and “that’s just how he is” and “he’s so sweet once you get to know him”…. Yeah, glad I trusted my gut over everyone who fell for his nice guy routine.

He and I shared a lot of interests so we would hang out a lot just the two of us, but always in public places. I would get a slightly weird vibe from him but ignore it since he was being nothing but friendly.

One night we had all been drinking at his place. I realized too late that I had missed the last bus home so I asked if I could crash on his couch until morning. Which in hindsight might have been the most stupid decision of my life, but I didn't think any of it at first as I was used to hanging out with him. 

The other people left and it was just him and me. I started getting a really bad feeling out of nowhere so instead of going to sleep like had planned I pretended I wasn't tired and kept talking to him. He offered to show me around his house. I agreed, but again had a very bad feeling about it so I made sure to put my phone in my pocket before I followed him and never put him between myself and the door. 

Nothing happened, we just stayed up talking and I felt really stupid as I left in the early morning hours.

Two weeks later he assaulted another girl in our group while she was at his house. 

After that I never ignore my gut feeling about a person."

When it was graduation time, he offered to plan our class party. He had connections and was a party guy, and noone else really wanted to take that on, so we sent him money. He took the money and left the country like a week before graduation.

I told my closest friend from the group and he said I was nuts and that ""Kevin"" (not his real name obviously) was a nice guy, he's into the same sports and tv shows as us and that he came across as a genuine guy. I replied that only time will tell. 
Forward a few years and Kevin and ""Jessie"" were married with two kids. My close friend reminded me of what I said all those years previously and smugly remarked about how wrong I was. 
Literally THE NEXT DAY Jessie announced their split to the group, saying he was stealing birthday and christmas cards from his job as a mail man, had asked both her (separated) parents to borrow their credit cards to book tickets for a show and skinned them for tens of thousands of dollars, and sold her car and the kids games consoles, all to fund his gambling addiction. And on top of that, he  was dipping his wick in all he could get and had gotten one woman pregnant during it all. 

Turns out I was right all along."

He was a regular kid- had some friends, played videogames, played football, and was somewhat quiet. I always had a weird vibe when I was around him, something about his eyes and the way he looked at people was terrifying me. At that time, he was just a regular kid who was good at fighting.

When he got into fights, he was fucking mental. Noone had ever beat him in a fist fight. There were a few fights he got into in elementary, and I saw him fight with other kids, but he never lost, just because of how fucking ferocious and merciless he was when he got the upper hand.

Couple of years down the road, I found out that after he entered secondary school, he went absolutely fucking nuts. Something in his head clicked, and he became extremely violent and agressive. He was not afraid to attack someone over the stupidest shit- like the way someone looked at him, when someone accidentally bumped into him, etc. He was also known to self harm, not because he was depressed, but because when he had a lot of pent up rage, he took it out on himself. 

One day, he got into an argument with a teacher. For some reason he pulled out a pen, stabbed himself in his left arm, and tore open his entire left hand, from elbow to wrist. Blood was spraying everywhere, and everyone fled the class, because he looked like he was about to attack them. Cops and paramedics were immediatelly called to the scene, and he was taken away. After he got out of hospital, he got sent to juvie. I talked to someone who saw that thing happen, and apparently, he fucked up his arm so bad that his bone was visible.

Noone really knows what happened afterwards. I heard some rumours, like that he completely lost control of his left arm, that he is permanently locked in a psychiatric hospital because he has schitzophrenia, and so on, but nothing concrete. I just hope that he is doing fine now."

after that we headed over to his place and had to act completely sober in front of his parents. after awhile it had been quite awhile since we had drank i was starting to feel/act more sober than a few hours before and from my point of view, he did too.

The minute I met her, every inch of my skin was on edge and I wanted to toss my drink in her face and run. She was just off, but not in a detectable way? Just knew I wanted nothing to do with her, despite her being outwardly pleasant. Being in her presence made me feel actually nauseous.

She lived with them for a year with no incident. During that time befriended a mutual acquaintance who said he felt crazy, but he just thought she was “insufferable,” despite having done nothing to him. I freaked out and said the same! We both were relieved and felt justified never doing anything with her present.

When it came time for all of the housemates to move, the off girl was told after inspection by the landlord she wouldn’t get her $350 deposit back because there were burn marks on the carpet from hookah coals. Now, to normal people this would seem a natural outcome. But no. She lost her ever loving shit. According to the friends, she raged, blamed them for her being “ripped off,” and left everything a mess. One night it all blew up and they all told her off and said she did the following when they woke up:

-all the utensils and dishes (not hers) were gone 

-all their coats and umbrellas in the front closet were shredded with scissors

-the couches and stuffed chairs (not hers) were slashed with a large kitchen knife. Sorry, I lied. There was one utensil left in the house, because the knife was stuck in one of the chairs wooden structure. 

-all condiments were emptied on the hardwood floors 

-worst of all, she stole friend’s cat. Friend got a call a few days later that her cat was found 200 miles away, wandering towards people in a truck stop, crying. It looked like she had been tossed from a moving car and had broken ribs, lost teeth, and had to have an eye removed. 

-girl ghosted. None of her contacts worked, and she was off the grid.

A new kid in high school joined our friend group.  He had shifty eyes, which no one noticed other than me.  I remember the first odd observation...it happened while watching TV at a friend's house...we were all watching a movie, and in the reflection of the glass covering the fireplace, I noticed that this new kid was the only one not watching the movie...he was observing everyone else.  I said something about it to my friend, and they thought I was just making shit up because I didn't like him.

About a week later, we're at another friends house having a party.  I spot this new kid filling up three beer cans with water (he thought he was alone in the kitchen, but I was in the other room being quiet).  When he left the kitchen, I noticed he hid two of the cans behind the flour and sugar jars.  Later in the night, I saw they were all gone (i.e. he returned to the kitchen to grab them, making it look like he was drinking a bunch of beers).  During that party, he acted extremely drunk, and went to go pass out in a bedroom upstairs.  I told people what I saw, and said there's no way he's that drunk...people thought he was either drinking water to prevent getting more drunk, or that (again) I was saying a made up lie, because ""I didn't like him"".

Well, a few things started happening.  First, one of my friends who was watching the movie realized he lost his wallet, and his credit card was used to buy a bunch of shit online, which was delivered to an unoccupied house in the neighborhood that was for sale.

Also, the night this new kid passed out, several bottles of wine were stolen from the house, and a giant water cooler jug of quarters were taken from the house (it had hundreds of dollars in there).

I was 1000% convinced that this new kid watched my friend put his wallet down somewhere then stole it.  And that when he was ""passed out"" upstairs, he was actually stealing the wine and quarters.

No one else accused him.  Over the next year, iPods were stolen, a laptop was stolen, video games were stolen...all these things kept happening at random houses that he was at.  NO ONE except me suspected it was this new kid...and some people even thought I was doing it, and trying to blame him as a cover (which really pissed me off).

Well, it just so happened that my cousin worked at gamestop, and at a family event, I was venting about this new  kid.  My cousin asked to see a photo, and instantly said that this guy comes in all the time selling used video games.  I don't remember why, but this never led to any security footage.  However, it gave me the idea to go to a pawnshop and ask them if they had seen this person.  Yep, he comes in all the time selling things.  THEY had security footage of him selling a laptop one day, an iPad another day, and other small items.

The worst part, is no one ever pressed charges on him.  He gave a sob story about how he was poor, and just needed to buy his own food etc, etc (all lies, but whatever).

TLDR: the fucker was stealing and I knew it."

Friends to the point B was M maid of honnor. 

B worked her ass off for her wedding and party and everything the maid of honor is in charge of, spent a lot of money and then bought her beautiful and expensive gifts cause that was THE day for one of her closest friend. 

Also, B is always here when M has an issue. 

On the other side, I felt like M was never asking about Bs life. Never asking her if she was ok. Was never really interested about anything concerning B. 

Ive talked about it to B but very soft. Telling her I felt like M was using her. She didn't really believe me and thought I was being extra. 

Back to yesterday, the third friend of B is taking care of Bs birthday present. 

M doesn't feel concerned. Doesn't want to look for anything. She wants third friend to do the job. 

We ALL decided we should go for the lion King. 

After buying tickets, M said she thought only B was going to see the show (what friend sends another friend to see a show alone the day of her birthday ffs). We explained this made no sense. The idea was to spend that time with her, She said she already seen the show and doesn't want to go. 

M also didn't offer to pay a bit for Bs ticket. Which is not even the issue at this point but the fact she doesn't want to spend time with her closest friend the day of her birthday.

And I cannot tell that to B who still thinks M is a great friend."

Then as I'm trying to get my life back together I'm growing increasingly concerned that my long term depression had finally manifested into some kind of delusion.

The weird thing is... all of this should be considered the worst part of my life. All of this shit should be driving me insane and making me want to kill myself more than I ever wanted to before. But it's not. It's just pissing me off and making want to become as dangerous as possible. 

It's weird, but I didn't stop thinking something was ""off"" with me until I realized that it was the world around me that was ""off"". I still don't know that absolute truth of what is going on so this could be a complete misinterpretation of what is really happening, but for the first time in my life I actually think I might be ""happy.""

They were like 20-something and attacking much younger people, including me. Well. When i spoke against them, i was called racist and no one believed me when i called them out. Well.

Like we'd be together talking about cartoons, superheroes and other random shit most of the time. And those where the only times she ever talked. She was dead silent in ALL lessons. Never answered any questions even when she knew the right answer because as she told me "" I don't want to gossip. Noone like such people "". Even then i felt something was off about her. 

And then suddenly she transferred schools. And started cutting her wanes regularly. I don't know how much of it is gossip but there apparently were 2 confirmed times. Based on her insta she's only slightly less suicidal and is already a single mother in her early 20s"

He was not afraid to attack someone over the stupidest shit- like the way someone looked at him, when someone accidentally bumped into him, etc. He was also known to self harm, not because he was depressed, but because when he had a lot of pent up rage, he took it out on himself. 

One day, he got into an argument with a teacher. For some reason he pulled out a pen, stabbed himself in his left arm, and tore open his entire left hand, from elbow to wrist. Blood was spraying everywhere, and everyone fled the class, because he looked like he was about to attack them. Cops and paramedics were immediatelly called to the scene, and he was taken away. After he got out of hospital, he got sent to juvie. I talked to someone who saw that thing happen, and apparently, he fucked up his arm so bad that his bone was visible.

Noone really knows what happened afterwards. I heard some rumours, like that he completely lost control of his left arm, that he is permanently locked in a psychiatric hospital because he has schitzophrenia, and so on, but nothing concrete. I just hope that he is doing fine now."

me and him were really close at one point and decided that we would get drunk, at first i felt uneasy as i do not drink and i wasn’t really comfortable with the idea of being around him and getting drunk as i know his personality. eventually he persuaded me to drink with him and after a few shots we were pretty drunk. 

after that we headed over to his place and had to act completely sober in front of his parents. after awhile it had been quite awhile since we had drank i was starting to feel/act more sober than a few hours before and from my point of view, he did too. 

after awhile he was starting to act his usual self and make the sexual comments but out of nowhere he started acting upon it too. at the end of the night he had sexually assaulted me and another girl. the friendship had ended shortly after that experience"

&gt; Daughters played a lot of soccer when they were younger, like between 8 and 18. There was a girl on their team who we all liked, a real sweetheart. Her mom was really nice, but the step-dad just gave me a ""creepy"" vibe I couldn't quite put a finger on.

&gt; Most other parents liked him, but there were a few like me who also saw him as creepy. Nothing overt, just an odd vibe to the point that some of us wouldn't let our daughters sleep over. I should note the step-dad NEVER let his step-daughter sleep over anywhere, ever.

&gt; Found out during her Junior year her mom caught the step-dad raping her. He'd been doing it for a number of years and she didn't say anything because she was so scared of him.

When I was still in high school, there was a kid in our church youth group that was very, very odd, he always gave me the heebee geebeez.  Like made my skin crawl and spine go cold if I spoke with him kinda creepy.

Everyone thought he was a harmless weirdo, I brought my concerns to others who told me to stop being judgemental, love your neighbor, the typical stuff ignorant old people say.

I left that church for good when they decided they should have a male nursery worker and picked him, to work alone with kids, and no cameras.

Fast forward a few years and he's now serving life with no chance of parole, he was arrested for thousands accounts of CP, his list of charges and victims was so long, over 100 children/teenagers testified in court, all while he smiled.

To be clear, I don't hate him as a person, I hate the actions he chose to do, yet he chose his path, now he's paying the price for his actions.

The prison keeps him in solitary under guard for his own protection, inmates have tried to kill him over a dozen times in the last couple years.

The minute I met her, every inch of my skin was on edge and I wanted to toss my drink in her face and run. She was just off, but not in a detectable way? Just knew I wanted nothing to do with her, despite her being outwardly pleasant. Being in her presence made me feel actually nauseous.

She lived with them for a year with no incident. During that time befriended a mutual acquaintance who said he felt crazy, but he just thought she was “insufferable,” despite having done nothing to him. I freaked out and said the same! We both were relieved and felt justified never doing anything with her present.

When it came time for all of the housemates to move, the off girl was told after inspection by the landlord she wouldn’t get her $350 deposit back because there were burn marks on the carpet from hookah coals. Now, to normal people this would seem a natural outcome. But no. She lost her ever loving shit. According to the friends, she raged, blamed them for her being “ripped off,” and left everything a mess. One night it all blew up and they all told her off and said she did the following when they woke up:

-all the utensils and dishes (not hers) were gone 

-all their coats and umbrellas in the front closet were shredded with scissors

-the couches and stuffed chairs (not hers) were slashed with a large kitchen knife. Sorry, I lied. There was one utensil left in the house, because the knife was stuck in one of the chairs wooden structure. 

-all condiments were emptied on the hardwood floors 

-worst of all, she stole friend’s cat. Friend got a call a few days later that her cat was found 200 miles away, wandering towards people in a truck stop, crying. It looked like she had been tossed from a moving car and had broken ribs, lost teeth, and had to have an eye removed. 

-girl ghosted. None of her contacts worked, and she was off the grid.

Police were called. Reports filed. She hasn’t physically been seen since that night. Last police tracked her a few years ago, she was living over in South East Asia/Australia as this boho expat.

A new kid in high school joined our friend group.  He had shifty eyes, which no one noticed other than me.  I remember the first odd observation...it happened while watching TV at a friend's house...we were all watching a movie, and in the reflection of the glass covering the fireplace, I noticed that this new kid was the only one not watching the movie...he was observing everyone else.  I said something about it to my friend, and they thought I was just making shit up because I didn't like him.

About a week later, we're at another friends house having a party.  I spot this new kid filling up three beer cans with water (he thought he was alone in the kitchen, but I was in the other room being quiet).  When he left the kitchen, I noticed he hid two of the cans behind the flour and sugar jars.  Later in the night, I saw they were all gone (i.e. he returned to the kitchen to grab them, making it look like he was drinking a bunch of beers).  During that party, he acted extremely drunk, and went to go pass out in a bedroom upstairs.  I told people what I saw, and said there's no way he's that drunk...people thought he was either drinking water to prevent getting more drunk, or that (again) I was saying a made up lie, because ""I didn't like him"".

Well, a few things started happening.  First, one of my friends who was watching the movie realized he lost his wallet, and his credit card was used to buy a bunch of shit online, which was delivered to an unoccupied house in the neighborhood that was for sale.

Also, the night this new kid passed out, several bottles of wine were stolen from the house, and a giant water cooler jug of quarters were taken from the house (it had hundreds of dollars in there).

I was 1000% convinced that this new kid watched my friend put his wallet down somewhere then stole it.  And that when he was ""passed out"" upstairs, he was actually stealing the wine and quarters.

No one else accused him.  Over the next year, iPods were stolen, a laptop was stolen, video games were stolen...all these things kept happening at random houses that he was at.  NO ONE except me suspected it was this new kid...and some people even thought I was doing it, and trying to blame him as a cover (which really pissed me off).

Well, it just so happened that my cousin worked at gamestop, and at a family event, I was venting about this new  kid.  My cousin asked to see a photo, and instantly said that this guy comes in all the time selling used video games.  I don't remember why, but this never led to any security footage.  However, it gave me the idea to go to a pawnshop and ask them if they had seen this person.  Yep, he comes in all the time selling things.  THEY had security footage of him selling a laptop one day, an iPad another day, and other small items.

The worst part, is no one ever pressed charges on him.  He gave a sob story about how he was poor, and just needed to buy his own food etc, etc (all lies, but whatever).

TLDR: the fucker was stealing and I knew it."

Friends to the point B was M maid of honnor. 

B worked her ass off for her wedding and party and everything the maid of honor is in charge of, spent a lot of money and then bought her beautiful and expensive gifts cause that was THE day for one of her closest friend. 

Also, B is always here when M has an issue. 

On the other side, I felt like M was never asking about Bs life. Never asking her if she was ok. Was never really interested about anything concerning B. 

Ive talked about it to B but very soft. Telling her I felt like M was using her. She didn't really believe me and thought I was being extra. 

Back to yesterday, the third friend of B is taking care of Bs birthday present. 

M doesn't feel concerned. Doesn't want to look for anything. She wants third friend to do the job. 

We ALL decided we should go for the lion King. 

After buying tickets, M said she thought only B was going to see the show (what friend sends another friend to see a show alone the day of her birthday ffs). We explained this made no sense. The idea was to spend that time with her, She said she already seen the show and doesn't want to go. 

M also didn't offer to pay a bit for Bs ticket. Which is not even the issue at this point but the fact she doesn't want to spend time with her closest friend the day of her birthday.

And I cannot tell that to B who still thinks M is a great friend."

All my life something has felt wrong. I'm still not sure exactly how to describe it. I've just always lived with a sense that things weren't really all they seemed to be. I struggled to accept that I was the one who was wrong and that I was doing something wrong. Or maybe I was fundamentally wrong. I attempted suicide in the summer of 2013. 

Then as I'm trying to get my life back together I'm growing increasingly concerned that my long term depression had finally manifested into some kind of delusion. It took me 2-3 years to finally admit to myself that I wasn't crazy and that this shit was really happening. I've spent the past several years thinking about my past, all my relationships, etc. 

The weird thing is... all of this should be considered the worst part of my life. All of this shit should be driving me insane and making me want to kill myself more than I ever wanted to before. But it's not. It's just pissing me off and making want to become as dangerous as possible. 

It's weird, but I didn't stop thinking something was ""off"" with me until I realized that it was the world around me that was ""off"". I still don't know that absolute truth of what is going on so this could be a complete misinterpretation of what is really happening, but for the first time in my life I actually think I might be ""happy."" 

But make no mistake. I still REALLY REALLY want to find the person most responsible for this shit... the one who has forced me to continue tolerating all this stupid bullshit instead of just being professional and giving me a quick and painless death.

He was 21 and was sexually harassing a 14 year old girl, which brought out a bunch of other shady shit he was doing involving minors, and how he’s in jail and a registered sex offender.

One night we had all been drinking at his place. I realized too late that I had missed the last bus home so I asked if I could crash on his couch until morning. Which in hindsight might have been the most stupid decision of my life, but I didn't think any of it at first as I was used to hanging out with him. 

The other people left and it was just him and me. I started getting a really bad feeling out of nowhere so instead of going to sleep like had planned I pretended I wasn't tired and kept talking to him. He offered to show me around his house. I agreed, but again had a very bad feeling about it so I made sure to put my phone in my pocket before I followed him and never put him between myself and the door.

He was a regular kid- had some friends, played videogames, played football, and was somewhat quiet. I always had a weird vibe when I was around him, something about his eyes and the way he looked at people was terrifying me. At that time, he was just a regular kid who was good at fighting.

When he got into fights, he was fucking mental. Noone had ever beat him in a fist fight. There were a few fights he got into in elementary, and I saw him fight with other kids, but he never lost, just because of how fucking ferocious and merciless he was when he got the upper hand.

Couple of years down the road, I found out that after he entered secondary school, he went absolutely fucking nuts. Something in his head clicked, and he became extremely violent and agressive. He was not afraid to attack someone over the stupidest shit- like the way someone looked at him, when someone accidentally bumped into him, etc. He was also known to self harm, not because he was depressed, but because when he had a lot of pent up rage, he took it out on himself. 

One day, he got into an argument with a teacher. For some reason he pulled out a pen, stabbed himself in his left arm, and tore open his entire left hand, from elbow to wrist. Blood was spraying everywhere, and everyone fled the class, because he looked like he was about to attack them. Cops and paramedics were immediatelly called to the scene, and he was taken away. After he got out of hospital, he got sent to juvie. I talked to someone who saw that thing happen, and apparently, he fucked up his arm so bad that his bone was visible.

Noone really knows what happened afterwards. I heard some rumours, like that he completely lost control of his left arm, that he is permanently locked in a psychiatric hospital because he has schitzophrenia, and so on, but nothing concrete. I just hope that he is doing fine now."

&gt; Daughters played a lot of soccer when they were younger, like between 8 and 18. There was a girl on their team who we all liked, a real sweetheart. Her mom was really nice, but the step-dad just gave me a ""creepy"" vibe I couldn't quite put a finger on.

&gt; Most other parents liked him, but there were a few like me who also saw him as creepy. Nothing overt, just an odd vibe to the point that some of us wouldn't let our daughters sleep over. I should note the step-dad NEVER let his step-daughter sleep over anywhere, ever.

&gt; Found out during her Junior year her mom caught the step-dad raping her. He'd been doing it for a number of years and she didn't say anything because she was so scared of him. He went to jail, and is forever on the Megan's list. I often wonder how the girl is doing, Mom moved them somewhere else right after this all happened."

When I was still in high school, there was a kid in our church youth group that was very, very odd, he always gave me the heebee geebeez.  Like made my skin crawl and spine go cold if I spoke with him kinda creepy.

Everyone thought he was a harmless weirdo, I brought my concerns to others who told me to stop being judgemental, love your neighbor, the typical stuff ignorant old people say.

I left that church for good when they decided they should have a male nursery worker and picked him, to work alone with kids, and no cameras.

Fast forward a few years and he's now serving life with no chance of parole, he was arrested for thousands accounts of CP, his list of charges and victims was so long, over 100 children/teenagers testified in court, all while he smiled.

To be clear, I don't hate him as a person, I hate the actions he chose to do, yet he chose his path, now he's paying the price for his actions.

The prison keeps him in solitary under guard for his own protection, inmates have tried to kill him over a dozen times in the last couple years.

The minute I met her, every inch of my skin was on edge and I wanted to toss my drink in her face and run. She was just off, but not in a detectable way? Just knew I wanted nothing to do with her, despite her being outwardly pleasant. Being in her presence made me feel actually nauseous.

She lived with them for a year with no incident. During that time befriended a mutual acquaintance who said he felt crazy, but he just thought she was “insufferable,” despite having done nothing to him. I freaked out and said the same! We both were relieved and felt justified never doing anything with her present.

When it came time for all of the housemates to move, the off girl was told after inspection by the landlord she wouldn’t get her $350 deposit back because there were burn marks on the carpet from hookah coals. Now, to normal people this would seem a natural outcome. But no. She lost her ever loving shit. According to the friends, she raged, blamed them for her being “ripped off,” and left everything a mess. One night it all blew up and they all told her off and said she did the following when they woke up:

-all the utensils and dishes (not hers) were gone 

-all their coats and umbrellas in the front closet were shredded with scissors

-the couches and stuffed chairs (not hers) were slashed with a large kitchen knife. Sorry, I lied. There was one utensil left in the house, because the knife was stuck in one of the chairs wooden structure. 

-all condiments were emptied on the hardwood floors 

-worst of all, she stole friend’s cat. Friend got a call a few days later that her cat was found 200 miles away, wandering towards people in a truck stop, crying. It looked like she had been tossed from a moving car and had broken ribs, lost teeth, and had to have an eye removed. 

-girl ghosted. None of her contacts worked, and she was off the grid.

Police were called. Reports filed. She hasn’t physically been seen since that night. Last police tracked her a few years ago, she was living over in South East Asia/Australia as this boho expat.

A new kid in high school joined our friend group.  He had shifty eyes, which no one noticed other than me.  I remember the first odd observation...it happened while watching TV at a friend's house...we were all watching a movie, and in the reflection of the glass covering the fireplace, I noticed that this new kid was the only one not watching the movie...he was observing everyone else.  I said something about it to my friend, and they thought I was just making shit up because I didn't like him.

About a week later, we're at another friends house having a party.  I spot this new kid filling up three beer cans with water (he thought he was alone in the kitchen, but I was in the other room being quiet).  When he left the kitchen, I noticed he hid two of the cans behind the flour and sugar jars.  Later in the night, I saw they were all gone (i.e. he returned to the kitchen to grab them, making it look like he was drinking a bunch of beers).  During that party, he acted extremely drunk, and went to go pass out in a bedroom upstairs.  I told people what I saw, and said there's no way he's that drunk...people thought he was either drinking water to prevent getting more drunk, or that (again) I was saying a made up lie, because ""I didn't like him"".

Well, a few things started happening.  First, one of my friends who was watching the movie realized he lost his wallet, and his credit card was used to buy a bunch of shit online, which was delivered to an unoccupied house in the neighborhood that was for sale.

Also, the night this new kid passed out, several bottles of wine were stolen from the house, and a giant water cooler jug of quarters were taken from the house (it had hundreds of dollars in there).

I was 1000% convinced that this new kid watched my friend put his wallet down somewhere then stole it.  And that when he was ""passed out"" upstairs, he was actually stealing the wine and quarters.

No one else accused him.  Over the next year, iPods were stolen, a laptop was stolen, video games were stolen...all these things kept happening at random houses that he was at.  NO ONE except me suspected it was this new kid...and some people even thought I was doing it, and trying to blame him as a cover (which really pissed me off).

Well, it just so happened that my cousin worked at gamestop, and at a family event, I was venting about this new  kid.  My cousin asked to see a photo, and instantly said that this guy comes in all the time selling used video games.  I don't remember why, but this never led to any security footage.  However, it gave me the idea to go to a pawnshop and ask them if they had seen this person.  Yep, he comes in all the time selling things.  THEY had security footage of him selling a laptop one day, an iPad another day, and other small items.

The worst part, is no one ever pressed charges on him.  He gave a sob story about how he was poor, and just needed to buy his own food etc, etc (all lies, but whatever).

TLDR: the fucker was stealing and I knew it."

Friends to the point B was M maid of honnor. 

B worked her ass off for her wedding and party and everything the maid of honor is in charge of, spent a lot of money and then bought her beautiful and expensive gifts cause that was THE day for one of her closest friend. 

Also, B is always here when M has an issue. 

On the other side, I felt like M was never asking about Bs life. Never asking her if she was ok. Was never really interested about anything concerning B. 

Ive talked about it to B but very soft. Telling her I felt like M was using her. She didn't really believe me and thought I was being extra. 

Back to yesterday, the third friend of B is taking care of Bs birthday present. 

M doesn't feel concerned. Doesn't want to look for anything. She wants third friend to do the job. 

We ALL decided we should go for the lion King. 

After buying tickets, M said she thought only B was going to see the show (what friend sends another friend to see a show alone the day of her birthday ffs). We explained this made no sense. The idea was to spend that time with her, She said she already seen the show and doesn't want to go. 

M also didn't offer to pay a bit for Bs ticket. Which is not even the issue at this point but the fact she doesn't want to spend time with her closest friend the day of her birthday.

And I cannot tell that to B who still thinks M is a great friend."

One day I specifically remember him leading me to one of the back rooms to help him move some boxes, and at the time I was very impressionable, but I knew something was up. He was rubbing my back and touching my shoulders in a very strange way and even at 7 I knew that something was wrong (I’m female btw).

All my life something has felt wrong. I'm still not sure exactly how to describe it. I've just always lived with a sense that things weren't really all they seemed to be. I struggled to accept that I was the one who was wrong and that I was doing something wrong. Or maybe I was fundamentally wrong. I attempted suicide in the summer of 2013. 

Then as I'm trying to get my life back together I'm growing increasingly concerned that my long term depression had finally manifested into some kind of delusion. It took me 2-3 years to finally admit to myself that I wasn't crazy and that this shit was really happening. I've spent the past several years thinking about my past, all my relationships, etc. 

The weird thing is... all of this should be considered the worst part of my life. All of this shit should be driving me insane and making me want to kill myself more than I ever wanted to before. But it's not. It's just pissing me off and making want to become as dangerous as possible. 

It's weird, but I didn't stop thinking something was ""off"" with me until I realized that it was the world around me that was ""off"". I still don't know that absolute truth of what is going on so this could be a complete misinterpretation of what is really happening, but for the first time in my life I actually think I might be ""happy."" 

But make no mistake. I still REALLY REALLY want to find the person most responsible for this shit... the one who has forced me to continue tolerating all this stupid bullshit instead of just being professional and giving me a quick and painless death. I suppose these people intend to live my life for me... cowards... this is no longer the home of the brave and it might not be the land of the free anymore either. maybe it never was I don't know."

My luck with friends was always up and down, sometimes I had a lot and other times I only had 1 or 2. During that 1 or 2 friend time at some point, a close friend brought over a special needs kid. He was pretty shy but overall a cool and nice guy. He would occasionally be clingy to us and the friend and I would just be like “Okay! Let’s hang out next time though. We wanna go play over there.” (I don’t like clingy people but thank gods I wasn’t rude to him as a kid.)

Since my and his class had school club together, I got to know him through a mutual friend (dunno if I am saying this right, but school club is a thing where you stay in school after all the classes are over, and wait until parents pick you up from school, meanwhile you play with toys and shit)."

The hung up and hyped myself up for a good 15 min to just yank it. I did with all my strength, it. Did. Not. Budge. Immediate pain, after that I called an ambulance they had to lift me out my house. When I got to the ER, the nurse asked to take my sock off. This was after X-ray’s to see if it was resting on a nerve which was responsible for wiggling a few of my toes. It was, and they planned to do a surgery’s as the woman is cutting the sock off it just fell out. Yep, no pressure or any pulling. I assume the sock was keeping it in after I yanked it earlier and it was no longer firmly in place. That was fun."

Rest assured the cake was saved. It didn’t even hurt immediately I was just like fuck that hurts. Picked my foot up and realized something was sticking. Then I was like damn it must be a mail or something I’ll just go back to my room and yank it out. I saw that it was a curtain bracket, ft my friends and showed them. The hung up and hyped myself up for a good 15 min to just yank it. I did with all my strength, it. Did. Not. Budge. Immediate pain, after that I called an ambulance they had to lift me out my house. When I got to the ER, the nurse asked to take my sock off. This was after X-ray’s to see if it was resting on a nerve which was responsible for wiggling a few of my toes. It was, and they planned to do a surgery’s as the woman is cutting the sock off it just fell out. Yep, no pressure or any pulling. I assume the sock was keeping it in after I yanked it earlier and it was no longer firmly in place. That was fun."
